10.1108/ijlma-07-2023-0154,Nexus between mandatory ESG disclosure regulation and abnormal stock returns: a study of an emerging economy,Rajesh Desai,International Journal of Law and Management,2023,"
Purpose
This study aims to study the response of the stock market to the announcement of compulsory environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure regulation in the context of the Indian economy – one of the largest emerging economies. The study also examines the role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure.


Design/methodology/approach
Daily stock price data of 940 listed companies has been collected for 276 trading days to compute abnormal returns. The current study is based on event study methodology to analyze the announcement effect of disclosure regulations. Furthermore, to check the robustness of results, cross-sectional regression has been applied to correct for potential heterogeneity.


Findings
Results of the event study signify that the equity share market has reacted positively and significantly to the mandatory ESG disclosure regulation. Furthermore, the study also confirms the mitigating role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure as carbon nonsensitive (non predisclosure) firms have witnessed a more intense effect of regulation as compared to sensitive (predisclosed) corporations.


Practical implications
Current findings assist managers in understanding investor perception toward nonfinancial disclosures. Corporate managers can use disclosure as a tool to enhance the firm value and reduce information asymmetry by providing relevant information. Furthermore, policymakers can use the findings of present research to disseminate the advantages of adopting ESG disclosure practices thereby improving the transparency and governance among business firms.


Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to provide empirical evidence on the market response to compulsory ESG disclosure framework in the emerging context of India. Furthermore, considering the infancy stage of ESG research, the present research contributes to the body of knowledge by empirically testing the disclosure theories.

Current ESG rating systems lack transparency in incorporating China’s unique industrial, economic, and cultural factors, creating reliability concerns for stakeholders managing supply chain sustainability risks. This study develops an explainable artificial intelligence framework using SHAP and permutation feature importance (PFI) methods to predict the ESG performance of Chinese firms. We analyze comprehensive ESG data of 1608 Chinese listed companies over 13 years (2009–2021), integrating financial and non-financial determinants traditionally examined in isolation. Empirical findings demonstrate that random forest algorithms significantly outperform multivariate linear regression in capturing nonlinear ESG relationships. Key non-financial determinants include patent portfolios, CSR training initiatives, pollutant emissions, and charitable donations, while financial factors such as current assets and gearing ratios prove influential. Sectoral analysis reveals that manufacturing firms are evaluated through pollutant emissions and technical capabilities, whereas non-manufacturing firms are assessed on business taxes and intangible assets. These insights provide essential tools for multinational corporations to anticipate supply chain sustainability conditions.",288950328,0,66,,

Elangovan",Investment Management and Financial Innovations,2025,"With the increasing global emphasis on responsible investing, this study explores the tradeoff between ESG and traditional financial metrics in shaping the investment decisions of retail investors in India. A within-subject experimental design was employed at Christ University, India, involving an initial sample of 75 participants, with 55 completing all three experiment rounds. The sample respondents evaluated masked stock profiles across three rounds, where updated financial and ESG information on masked stock was provided at each round. The results indicate that though ESG metrics are getting attention among retail investors, financial metrics are still the main determining factor for investment. It was found that ROE (52 responses), 3-year CAGR Net Profit (36 responses), and P/E ratios (48 responses) are the most influencing factors to make investment decisions. Similarly, ESG factors (Governance, Environmental, and Sustainability scores) are also frequently mentioned, with 74 citations. Retail investors mainly consider profitability and view ESG as risk-mitigating or neutralizing factors. While evaluating the ESG factors, retailers mainly look at the firm’s environmental concerns, followed by governance and social factors. This result contrasts with the previous studies in this domain, where the literature emphasized governance factors more than environmental factors. These results highlight the integration of ESG elements, as retail investors remain with favorable returns and sacrifice sustainability. Further, this study spots the need for better and quantifiable ESG performance reports to consider alternative data comparable to financial data for better investment decisions.",284969996,3,47,,

10.1108/ijlma-07-2023-0154,Nexus between mandatory ESG disclosure regulation and abnormal stock returns: a study of an emerging economy,Rajesh Desai,International Journal of Law and Management,2023,"
Purpose
This study aims to study the response of the stock market to the announcement of compulsory environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure regulation in the context of the Indian economy – one of the largest emerging economies. The study also examines the role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure.


Design/methodology/approach
Daily stock price data of 940 listed companies has been collected for 276 trading days to compute abnormal returns. The current study is based on event study methodology to analyze the announcement effect of disclosure regulations. Furthermore, to check the robustness of results, cross-sectional regression has been applied to correct for potential heterogeneity.


Findings
Results of the event study signify that the equity share market has reacted positively and significantly to the mandatory ESG disclosure regulation. Furthermore, the study also confirms the mitigating role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure as carbon nonsensitive (non predisclosure) firms have witnessed a more intense effect of regulation as compared to sensitive (predisclosed) corporations.


Practical implications
Current findings assist managers in understanding investor perception toward nonfinancial disclosures. Corporate managers can use disclosure as a tool to enhance the firm value and reduce information asymmetry by providing relevant information. Furthermore, policymakers can use the findings of present research to disseminate the advantages of adopting ESG disclosure practices thereby improving the transparency and governance among business firms.


Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to provide empirical evidence on the market response to compulsory ESG disclosure framework in the emerging context of India. Furthermore, considering the infancy stage of ESG research, the present research contributes to the body of knowledge by empirically testing the disclosure theories.

Current ESG rating systems lack transparency in incorporating China’s unique industrial, economic, and cultural factors, creating reliability concerns for stakeholders managing supply chain sustainability risks. This study develops an explainable artificial intelligence framework using SHAP and permutation feature importance (PFI) methods to predict the ESG performance of Chinese firms. We analyze comprehensive ESG data of 1608 Chinese listed companies over 13 years (2009–2021), integrating financial and non-financial determinants traditionally examined in isolation. Empirical findings demonstrate that random forest algorithms significantly outperform multivariate linear regression in capturing nonlinear ESG relationships. Key non-financial determinants include patent portfolios, CSR training initiatives, pollutant emissions, and charitable donations, while financial factors such as current assets and gearing ratios prove influential. Sectoral analysis reveals that manufacturing firms are evaluated through pollutant emissions and technical capabilities, whereas non-manufacturing firms are assessed on business taxes and intangible assets. These insights provide essential tools for multinational corporations to anticipate supply chain sustainability conditions.",288950328,0,66,,

Elangovan",Investment Management and Financial Innovations,2025,"With the increasing global emphasis on responsible investing, this study explores the tradeoff between ESG and traditional financial metrics in shaping the investment decisions of retail investors in India. A within-subject experimental design was employed at Christ University, India, involving an initial sample of 75 participants, with 55 completing all three experiment rounds. The sample respondents evaluated masked stock profiles across three rounds, where updated financial and ESG information on masked stock was provided at each round. The results indicate that though ESG metrics are getting attention among retail investors, financial metrics are still the main determining factor for investment. It was found that ROE (52 responses), 3-year CAGR Net Profit (36 responses), and P/E ratios (48 responses) are the most influencing factors to make investment decisions. Similarly, ESG factors (Governance, Environmental, and Sustainability scores) are also frequently mentioned, with 74 citations. Retail investors mainly consider profitability and view ESG as risk-mitigating or neutralizing factors. While evaluating the ESG factors, retailers mainly look at the firm’s environmental concerns, followed by governance and social factors. This result contrasts with the previous studies in this domain, where the literature emphasized governance factors more than environmental factors.

Moreover, these rating agencies primarily focus on evaluating publicly listed large-cap companies, rendering their assessment approaches unsuitable for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that lack sufficient resources to support ESG evaluations. This study aims to develop an SME-specific ESG rating system that integrates both indirect and direct approaches. To facilitate responsible and reliable ESG evaluations, the indirect approach employs causal inference technique to identify the most relevant variables affecting ESG ratings in large listed companies. Subsequently, three machine learning-based predictive models are trained using this data, which are then applied to SMEs with a bridging strategy to derive their potential ESG ratings. The direct approach categorizes SMEs by industry and applies customized ESG performance indicators to assess their actual ESG ratings.

 This paper aims to investigate whether and how different levels of digital financial literacy (DFL) foster sustainable investing.
 
 
 
 The authors use a large, representative sample of more than 5,000 Italian households (Edufin Report, 2023), representing individuals responsible for managing the family finances. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to assess respondents’ DFL, which reflects self-reported confidence in conducting financial transactions through digital devices. The paper adopts probit models to investigate the link between DFL and holding at least one sustainable asset in households’ portfolio while controlling for certain socio-demographic and behavioural variables.
 
 
 
 The results show that DFL has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of holding sustainable investments, but only among investors with advanced digital skills that enable them to manage sophisticated financial activities (e.g. investing or pension management). The results are robust to alternative measures of DFL and to endogeneity concerns. In particular, the most predictive measures of DFL relate to investors’ behaviours and attitudes towards, rather than awareness of, digital financial services. The behavioural dimension is further supported by the positive association between sustainable investment holding and self-assessed financial literacy, optimism and overconfidence.
 
 
 
 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to empirically connect DFL to sustainable investment holdings among individual investors. Building on previous insights on digitalisation and sustainability in the business context, this study identifies DFL as a critical enabler of households’ sustainable investments. This study provides new evidence on how promoting advanced digital skills can foster financial inclusion and support the uptake of environmental, social and governance investments among households.

In particular, the potential roles of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and blockchain (BC) in the ESG market have not been fully explored. Purpose of the article: This study explores the deep integration of digital technology and ESG by evaluating the correlation and spillover effects among AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices. Methods: This study explores the spillovers between AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices by cross-quantilogram and quantile time-frequency connectedness approaches. Findings &amp; value addition: The lower quantile of ESG returns has a weak positive (strong negative) correlation with the lower (upper) quantile of digital technology. Next, the spillover effects vary with time, frequency, and quantile levels. Meanwhile, the North America and Asia-Pacific developed ESG indices serve as the transmitter and receiver of spillover effects, respectively. Furthermore, the dependence between digital technology and ESG returns is insignificant before the COVID-19 crisis but increases after it. This quantile-dependent asymmetry fundamentally challenges linear assumptions prevalent in current ESG-technology integration theories. Overall, this study contributes by integrating AI, CC, BC, and ESG into a unified framework, and analyzing their interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, it dynamically analyzes the asymmetry over long and short-term horizons, and highlights the hedging role of digital technology in stabilizing ESG markets. Moreover, we provide novel insights about the interconnectedness between these markets, offering valuable guidance on risk management. Consequently, regulators should urgently explore the development of digital asset-based ESG derivatives as targeted risk mitigation tools. Positioned at the cutting-edge, this work sets a methodological benchmark for analyzing non-linear, frequency-sensitive interdependencies within the rapidly evolving ESG-digital nexus, transforming the theoretical framework from static linearities to dynamic non-linearities.

These findings suggested that AI improved the informational efficiency of ESG assessment by capturing more accurate, forward-looking sustainability risks and opportunities. The study concluded that AI-driven ESG analytics strengthened the financial relevance of sustainability integration and supported better-informed investment decision-making. The results carried important implications for investors, regulators and corporations seeking to align AI deployment with high-integrity sustainable finance practices, while also highlighting the need for ethical and transparent AI governance in financial markets.

10.3390/su17094238,AI vs. ESG? Uncovering a Bidirectional Struggle in China’s Sustainable Finance,"Zizhe Du, Chao Chen",Sustainability,2025,"As global discourse increasingly centers on environmental, social, and governance considerations, ESG investment has become a major trend in financial markets. Artificial intelligence (AI), through its rapid evolution, has exerted a transformative influence that continues to reshape the fundamental structures of this domain. This study investigates the dynamic relationship between AI and ESG investment indices in China, aiming to reveal the bidirectional causal linkages and time-dependent interactions between these two critical areas. In methods, we used four different parameter stability tests to indicate that the Granger causality test based on the full-sample VAR model may produce biased results. Therefore, we employed a bootstrap rolling-window subsample Granger causality test using data from January 2013 to September 2024 in China. The results reveal a significant dynamic relationship between ESG investment and AI. In key findings, we find that AI exerts a negative impact on ESG investment. AI development attracts substantial capital inflows that favor technological advancement and commercialization over long-term ESG investments. Meanwhile, ESG investment shows both positive and negative effects on AI. The positive effect indicates that ESG investment promotes AI research and applications emphasizing energy efficiency, data privacy, and fairness, thereby supporting the sustainable development of AI technologies. However, driven by short-term economic returns, strict ESG standards and compliance requirements may, in the short term, constrain the development of certain energy-intensive or emerging AI technologies. In economic and political implications, our study provides policymakers with scientific evidence to improve the ESG investment environment and to design balanced policies that support both AI development and sustainable investment practices. It underscores the necessity of promoting coordinated development between AI and ESG investment to achieve global sustainability goals and recommends measures to align short-term economic interests with long-term ESG objectives. This study is expected to serve as a scientific basis for ESG goal-setting and contribute to the realization of China’s dual-carbon goals. In particular, it facilitates the convergence of artificial intelligence technologies with sustainable development initiatives and tells the importance of responsible technological progress for global sustainable development.",286899601,4,113,,

Businesses are releasing more information on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance to stay competitive. In general, there is a negative correlation between volatility and higher ESG ratings as well as value and profitability. Investors are irritated by the lack of standardized ESG data, albeit as a result of the quick expansion of ESG investments, which has increased the amount of ESG data and rating providers. There are several measures and parameters offered by ESG rating providers, which can cause issuers to become exhausted from reporting on sustainability concerns. Conversely, the complexity of various ESG measures makes it difficult to make direct comparisons between businesses, especially when comparing them in different sectors. Emerging artificial intelligence capabilities can close the ESG disclosure gap and offer new perspectives on the ESG data that is currently available, which could help address these issues. The objective of this project was to automatically extract and analyze company ESG initiatives and keywords from ESG reports, as well as news and articles from other parties, using the Tunicate Swarm Optimized Dynamic Support Vector Machine (TSO-DSVM). With this method, an internal ESG score that is more accurate and understandable could be generated. The relationship between this internal ESG score and market risk in inclusive ESG investing portfolios will be evaluated by integrating it into the study. The proposed method has performed well than the existing methods with an F1-score of 89.44%, recall of 88.65%, precision of 90.75%, and an accuracy of 92.54%. The findings suggest that decreased value at risk is favorably associated with an increased internal ESG score, which improves risk management tactics for investors in the ESG sector.",286944908,6,28,,

The growth of the economy can be sped up by the effective management of ESG risks through sustainable business practices. To promote sustainable development and to secure the long-term welfare of employees, customers, and all other stakeholders in the economy, companies must adapt and reposition their business strategies and organizational cultures. The goal of this paper is to determine how a set of common ESG elements, chosen from the viewpoints of sustainability and well-being, influence economic growth in the Western Balkan countries. For each ESG component, we used different variables. The information pertains to the five Western Balkan countries of North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia. Because of a lack of data, Kosovo is excluded from the study. Then, we compared results from the analysis of the Western Balkan countries with a set of countries in Southeast Europe, which are members of the European Union and essentially coincide with the Western Europe countries. We performed multiple regression analysis with applied fixed effects to the data model. According to the study’s findings, each of the independent variables had no significant impact on the GDP’s annual growth of the Western Balkan countries, but two of the variables, life expectancy at birth and labor force participation, have certain impact on the GDP growth of Southeast Europe countries, which are members of the European Union. The green transition has gained significant importance in the Western Balkan countries as a crucial pathway toward sustainable economic growth, though it introduces a range of new social and economic challenges. Economically, these nations are confronted with considerable funding requirements for development. To build sustainable societies, it would be beneficial for these countries to explore more creative financing strategies.

Findings from the Quantile-on-Quantile Connectedness analysis reveal that the carbon market serves as a net shock transmitter across most quantile combinations; however, this role exhibits significant asymmetry, with transmission intensifying during extreme market conditions. Put differently, in certain periods characterized by heightened technological momentum, the AI indices also generate a meaningful feedback effect toward the carbon market. These interactions intensify in extreme quantile regimes, indicating stronger market integration during periods of stress. The results demonstrate that the financial structure of carbon pricing and the AI sector is becoming increasingly intertwined, and that sustainability policies need to be reconsidered in a manner that appropriately accounts for developments in technology markets.",297271885,0,41,,

It aims to explore how AI integration enhances the interpretability and predictive accuracy of ESG metrics in shaping market perceptions and investor decisions. This study employs a panel dataset from 2018 to 2024, analysing publicly listed non-financial firms across five major sectors: manufacturing, energy, telecommunications, consumer goods, and industrials. This study contributed by employing AI-powered multimodal analysis with conventional ESG scoring methods and integrating Fixed-Effects Regression with machine learning (ML) algorithms including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest to identify complex, non-linear relationships within ESG data and firm valuation. The results show empirical evidence that integrating ML enhances the explanatory power of ESG data. Findings indicate that ESG performance is positively correlated with higher market valuations, particularly in Environmental and Social dimensions. Governance metrics are more inconsistent, which may be due to heterogeneity in governance practices, regulatory enforcement and the challenges of quantifying governance quality beyond compliance indicators across the focus emerging markets. Firms identified in ESG controversies tend to face valuation penalties, which stresses market sensitivity to reputational risks. ML algorithms outperform conventional techniques in predictive accuracy, revealing complex, non-linear interactions within ESG data. This study contributes to both the academic literature and practice showing how next-generation ESG reporting can robust valuation models, address limitations of conventional ESG scoring, and ensure a reliable outlook for investors and policymakers of industries in emerging markets.",294184816,1,44,,

Moreover, these rating agencies primarily focus on evaluating publicly listed large-cap companies, rendering their assessment approaches unsuitable for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that lack sufficient resources to support ESG evaluations. This study aims to develop an SME-specific ESG rating system that integrates both indirect and direct approaches. To facilitate responsible and reliable ESG evaluations, the indirect approach employs causal inference technique to identify the most relevant variables affecting ESG ratings in large listed companies. Subsequently, three machine learning-based predictive models are trained using this data, which are then applied to SMEs with a bridging strategy to derive their potential ESG ratings. The direct approach categorizes SMEs by industry and applies customized ESG performance indicators to assess their actual ESG ratings. Finally, the two rating results are integrated using a weighted formula, accompanied by the implementation of Microsoft Power BI's visualized and interactive features, to establish a transparent, explainable, and interpretable SME-specific ESG rating system.",283468785,0,9,,

Model accuracy is assessed through MAE, RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and R2, complemented by statistical significance tests. Results show no consistent improvement in predictive performance for high-ESG firms, with only the Business Services sector displaying a marginal effect. These findings challenge the assumption that ESG integration inherently reduces forecast uncertainty, suggesting instead that ESG scores contribute little to predictive accuracy under long-term investment conditions.

 This paper aims to investigate whether and how different levels of digital financial literacy (DFL) foster sustainable investing.
 
 
 
 The authors use a large, representative sample of more than 5,000 Italian households (Edufin Report, 2023), representing individuals responsible for managing the family finances. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to assess respondents’ DFL, which reflects self-reported confidence in conducting financial transactions through digital devices. The paper adopts probit models to investigate the link between DFL and holding at least one sustainable asset in households’ portfolio while controlling for certain socio-demographic and behavioural variables.
 
 
 
 The results show that DFL has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of holding sustainable investments, but only among investors with advanced digital skills that enable them to manage sophisticated financial activities (e.g. investing or pension management). The results are robust to alternative measures of DFL and to endogeneity concerns. In particular, the most predictive measures of DFL relate to investors’ behaviours and attitudes towards, rather than awareness of, digital financial services. The behavioural dimension is further supported by the positive association between sustainable investment holding and self-assessed financial literacy, optimism and overconfidence.
 
 
 
 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to empirically connect DFL to sustainable investment holdings among individual investors. Building on previous insights on digitalisation and sustainability in the business context, this study identifies DFL as a critical enabler of households’ sustainable investments. This study provides new evidence on how promoting advanced digital skills can foster financial inclusion and support the uptake of environmental, social and governance investments among households.

In particular, the potential roles of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and blockchain (BC) in the ESG market have not been fully explored. Purpose of the article: This study explores the deep integration of digital technology and ESG by evaluating the correlation and spillover effects among AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices. Methods: This study explores the spillovers between AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices by cross-quantilogram and quantile time-frequency connectedness approaches. Findings &amp; value addition: The lower quantile of ESG returns has a weak positive (strong negative) correlation with the lower (upper) quantile of digital technology. Next, the spillover effects vary with time, frequency, and quantile levels. Meanwhile, the North America and Asia-Pacific developed ESG indices serve as the transmitter and receiver of spillover effects, respectively. Furthermore, the dependence between digital technology and ESG returns is insignificant before the COVID-19 crisis but increases after it. This quantile-dependent asymmetry fundamentally challenges linear assumptions prevalent in current ESG-technology integration theories. Overall, this study contributes by integrating AI, CC, BC, and ESG into a unified framework, and analyzing their interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, it dynamically analyzes the asymmetry over long and short-term horizons, and highlights the hedging role of digital technology in stabilizing ESG markets. Moreover, we provide novel insights about the interconnectedness between these markets, offering valuable guidance on risk management. Consequently, regulators should urgently explore the development of digital asset-based ESG derivatives as targeted risk mitigation tools. Positioned at the cutting-edge, this work sets a methodological benchmark for analyzing non-linear, frequency-sensitive interdependencies within the rapidly evolving ESG-digital nexus, transforming the theoretical framework from static linearities to dynamic non-linearities. Finally, this study proposes some reasonable suggestions, including raising risk awareness, promoting digital transformation, building integration and innovation platforms, and leveraging ESG’s diffusion role.",289701960,3,102,,

In this paper, to address the problem of low accuracy of power load prediction, we propose a method that combines secondary data cleaning and adaptive variational mode decomposition (VMD), convolutional neural networks (CNN), bi-directional long short-term memory (BILSTM), and adding attention mechanism (AM). The Inner Mongolia electricity load data were first cleaned use the K-means algorithm, and then further refined with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with the noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Subsequently, the parameters of the VMD algorithm were optimized using a multi-strategy Cubic-T dung beetle optimization algorithm (CTDBO), after which the VMD algorithm was employed to decompose the twice-cleaned load sequences into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequencies. These IMFs were then used as inputs to the CNN-BILSTM-Attention model. In this model, a CNN is used for feature extraction, BILSTM for extracting information from the load sequence, and AM for assigning different weights to different features to optimize the prediction results.

While traditional ESG ratings had been widely used in responsible investment strategies, they often suffered from data inconsistency, subjectivity and limited coverage of unstructured sustainability information. AI-based ESG systems were increasingly applied to extract deeper sustainability signals from corporate disclosures, reports and external data sources. Using portfolio-level analysis, this study compared the financial outcomes of portfolios constructed using AI-driven ESG indicators with those based on conventional ESG ratings. The results showed that AI-enhanced high-ESG portfolios achieved higher mean returns and superior Sharpe ratios than both AI-based low-ESG portfolios and traditionally rated ESG portfolios. In addition, AI-driven high-ESG portfolios demonstrated lower downside-risk exposure and smaller maximum drawdowns during market stress, indicating stronger resilience. Regression analysis further revealed that AI-derived ESG scores were more strongly associated with excess returns than traditional ESG metrics. These findings suggested that AI improved the informational efficiency of ESG assessment by capturing more accurate, forward-looking sustainability risks and opportunities. The study concluded that AI-driven ESG analytics strengthened the financial relevance of sustainability integration and supported better-informed investment decision-making. The results carried important implications for investors, regulators and corporations seeking to align AI deployment with high-integrity sustainable finance practices, while also highlighting the need for ethical and transparent AI governance in financial markets.

Uncovering a Bidirectional Struggle in China’s Sustainable Finance,"Zizhe Du, Chao Chen",Sustainability,2025,"As global discourse increasingly centers on environmental, social, and governance considerations, ESG investment has become a major trend in financial markets. Artificial intelligence (AI), through its rapid evolution, has exerted a transformative influence that continues to reshape the fundamental structures of this domain. This study investigates the dynamic relationship between AI and ESG investment indices in China, aiming to reveal the bidirectional causal linkages and time-dependent interactions between these two critical areas. In methods, we used four different parameter stability tests to indicate that the Granger causality test based on the full-sample VAR model may produce biased results. Therefore, we employed a bootstrap rolling-window subsample Granger causality test using data from January 2013 to September 2024 in China. The results reveal a significant dynamic relationship between ESG investment and AI. In key findings, we find that AI exerts a negative impact on ESG investment. AI development attracts substantial capital inflows that favor technological advancement and commercialization over long-term ESG investments. Meanwhile, ESG investment shows both positive and negative effects on AI. The positive effect indicates that ESG investment promotes AI research and applications emphasizing energy efficiency, data privacy, and fairness, thereby supporting the sustainable development of AI technologies. However, driven by short-term economic returns, strict ESG standards and compliance requirements may, in the short term, constrain the development of certain energy-intensive or emerging AI technologies. In economic and political implications, our study provides policymakers with scientific evidence to improve the ESG investment environment and to design balanced policies that support both AI development and sustainable investment practices. It underscores the necessity of promoting coordinated development between AI and ESG investment to achieve global sustainability goals and recommends measures to align short-term economic interests with long-term ESG objectives. This study is expected to serve as a scientific basis for ESG goal-setting and contribute to the realization of China’s dual-carbon goals. In particular, it facilitates the convergence of artificial intelligence technologies with sustainable development initiatives and tells the importance of responsible technological progress for global sustainable development.",286899601,4,113,,

Businesses are releasing more information on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance to stay competitive. In general, there is a negative correlation between volatility and higher ESG ratings as well as value and profitability. Investors are irritated by the lack of standardized ESG data, albeit as a result of the quick expansion of ESG investments, which has increased the amount of ESG data and rating providers. There are several measures and parameters offered by ESG rating providers, which can cause issuers to become exhausted from reporting on sustainability concerns. Conversely, the complexity of various ESG measures makes it difficult to make direct comparisons between businesses, especially when comparing them in different sectors. Emerging artificial intelligence capabilities can close the ESG disclosure gap and offer new perspectives on the ESG data that is currently available, which could help address these issues. The objective of this project was to automatically extract and analyze company ESG initiatives and keywords from ESG reports, as well as news and articles from other parties, using the Tunicate Swarm Optimized Dynamic Support Vector Machine (TSO-DSVM). With this method, an internal ESG score that is more accurate and understandable could be generated. The relationship between this internal ESG score and market risk in inclusive ESG investing portfolios will be evaluated by integrating it into the study. The proposed method has performed well than the existing methods with an F1-score of 89.44%, recall of 88.65%, precision of 90.75%, and an accuracy of 92.54%. The findings suggest that decreased value at risk is favorably associated with an increased internal ESG score, which improves risk management tactics for investors in the ESG sector.",286944908,6,28,,

The growth of the economy can be sped up by the effective management of ESG risks through sustainable business practices. To promote sustainable development and to secure the long-term welfare of employees, customers, and all other stakeholders in the economy, companies must adapt and reposition their business strategies and organizational cultures. The goal of this paper is to determine how a set of common ESG elements, chosen from the viewpoints of sustainability and well-being, influence economic growth in the Western Balkan countries. For each ESG component, we used different variables. The information pertains to the five Western Balkan countries of North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia. Because of a lack of data, Kosovo is excluded from the study. Then, we compared results from the analysis of the Western Balkan countries with a set of countries in Southeast Europe, which are members of the European Union and essentially coincide with the Western Europe countries. We performed multiple regression analysis with applied fixed effects to the data model. According to the study’s findings, each of the independent variables had no significant impact on the GDP’s annual growth of the Western Balkan countries, but two of the variables, life expectancy at birth and labor force participation, have certain impact on the GDP growth of Southeast Europe countries, which are members of the European Union. The green transition has gained significant importance in the Western Balkan countries as a crucial pathway toward sustainable economic growth, though it introduces a range of new social and economic challenges. Economically, these nations are confronted with considerable funding requirements for development. To build sustainable societies, it would be beneficial for these countries to explore more creative financing strategies.

Findings from the Quantile-on-Quantile Connectedness analysis reveal that the carbon market serves as a net shock transmitter across most quantile combinations; however, this role exhibits significant asymmetry, with transmission intensifying during extreme market conditions. Put differently, in certain periods characterized by heightened technological momentum, the AI indices also generate a meaningful feedback effect toward the carbon market. These interactions intensify in extreme quantile regimes, indicating stronger market integration during periods of stress. The results demonstrate that the financial structure of carbon pricing and the AI sector is becoming increasingly intertwined, and that sustainability policies need to be reconsidered in a manner that appropriately accounts for developments in technology markets.",297271885,0,41,,

It aims to explore how AI integration enhances the interpretability and predictive accuracy of ESG metrics in shaping market perceptions and investor decisions. This study employs a panel dataset from 2018 to 2024, analysing publicly listed non-financial firms across five major sectors: manufacturing, energy, telecommunications, consumer goods, and industrials. This study contributed by employing AI-powered multimodal analysis with conventional ESG scoring methods and integrating Fixed-Effects Regression with machine learning (ML) algorithms including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest to identify complex, non-linear relationships within ESG data and firm valuation. The results show empirical evidence that integrating ML enhances the explanatory power of ESG data. Findings indicate that ESG performance is positively correlated with higher market valuations, particularly in Environmental and Social dimensions. Governance metrics are more inconsistent, which may be due to heterogeneity in governance practices, regulatory enforcement and the challenges of quantifying governance quality beyond compliance indicators across the focus emerging markets. Firms identified in ESG controversies tend to face valuation penalties, which stresses market sensitivity to reputational risks. ML algorithms outperform conventional techniques in predictive accuracy, revealing complex, non-linear interactions within ESG data.

This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by examining the impact of green finance on environmental sustainability. Green finance development is represented by GDP, investment in renewable energy sources, investment in research and development (R&D) for eco-friendly projects, and public–private partnership investment in renewable energy projects. Green financing development in the chosen panel exhibits a distinct geographical cluster effect, with significant regional variances. The most important influencing elements are regional GDP, regional innovation level, and air quality, whereas the degree of financial development and industrial structure optimization are insignificant. The degree of financial development and industrial structure optimization are related to the amount of green finance development mostly via spillover effects. The degree of financial development has a positive spillover impact, but industrial structure optimization has a negative spillover effect. This study reveals that an increase in the production of energy from renewable sources, an increase in R&D, and the evolution of public–private partnership investment in renewable energy reduce CO2 emissions. It is evidenced that green finance in renewable energy sources is necessary to achieve environmental sustainability. There is a strong need to increase green finance in renewable sources to target the minimization of global CO2 emissions. There should be cross-border trade of renewable energy between regions/countries to mitigate CO2 emissions globally. Moreover, this study ranks the regions based on environmental sustainability, which may help researchers and decision-makers to entice foreign direct and private investment in these regions. The implications of the findings of the study suggest that environmental sustainability benefits greatly from green financing and investing in renewable energy sources through public–private partnerships, which represents one of the best ways to ensure environmental sustainability.",251330686,71,63,,

We find that impacts from OP on the GBI are positive in the short run. The positive effects indicate that high OP can promote the development of the green bond market, indicating that green bonds can be considered an asset to avoid OP shocks. However, in the medium and long term, there is a negative impact due to the oversupply of the oil market and the increase in green energy industry profits. These results are identical to the supply and demand-based correlation model of green bonds and oil price, which underlines a specific effect of OP on GBI. The GBI effect on OP is consistently positive across all quantiles. It indicates that green bonds cannot be considered efficient measures to alleviate the oil crisis due to the instability of the Middle East COVID-19 and the small scale of green bonds. The issuers of green bonds can make decisions based on OP. Understanding the relationship between OP and GBI is also beneficial for investors.",64842793,64,130,,

Therefore, the present research examines the linkage between energy use (non-renewable and renewable energy), oil prices, and CO2 emissions in 30 European countries between 1997 and 2017. The study applied fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), Westerlund (2007) cointegration and the Driscoll-Kraay Regression tests to explore these associations. The result of individual samples and the full sample provides the same intimations for the use of energy in Europe. The outcomes of the research ratify the existence of a long-run relationship among variables and found that non-renewable energy consumption increases CO2 emissions, while renewable energy consumption mitigates CO2 emissions. Furthermore, when the oil prices rise, people switch towards substitute energy sources that reduce CO2 emissions. Based on the results, the study suggests that European countries should increase the share of renewable energy, promote the use of clean energy resources, and discourage fossil fuel energy consumption to ensure sustainability.",67879491,63,62,,

It is even more important for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries because of their potential for economic growth and the challenge of their environmental problems. This paper therefore addresses the question of whether and how green finance (with the proxy of issued green bonds [GBs]) promotes energy efficiency (with the proxy of energy intensity) in the ASEAN member countries.Design/methodology/approachThe paper runs a two-stage generalized method of moments (GMM) system model for the quarterly data over the period 2017–2020. It also uses a linear interaction model to explore how the pandemic may affect the relationship between green finance and energy efficiency in this region.FindingsThe main results only demonstrate the short-term negative impact of GBs on energy intensity. Furthermore, per capita income, economic integration and renewable energy supply can be used as potential variables to reduce energy intensity, while modernization in ASEAN increases energy intensity. Establishment of digital green finance, long-term planning of a green finance market, trade liberalization and policies to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 are recommended as golden policy implications.Research limitations/implicationsThe present study has several limitations. First, it accounts for explanatory variables by following a number of previous studies. This may lead to omissions or errors. Second, the empirical estimates were conducted for 160 observations due to the repositioning of GBs in ASEAN, which is not bad but not good for an empirical study.Originality/valueTo the best of authors' knowledge, there has not been any in-depth study focusing on the relationship between energy efficiency and green financing for the case of ASEAN economies.",14842791,46,102,,

Like the other extensively growing industries, China's Film and Drama industries are responsible for contributing effectively toward a sustainable environment. In order to validate the same, this study has applied the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) technique, so as to identify the asymmetric association among the Film and Drama Industry, green innovation, and sustainable environment. The quarterly time-series data of the variables is assessed from January 2000 to December 2019. The outcomes of the study have revealed that the appreciation in the Film and Drama stock prices tends to increase the CO2 emissions. Whereas, the depreciation of the Film and Drama stock prices improves the efforts towards a sustainable environment. On the other hand, the increase in green innovation tends to have an adverse impact on environmental degradation, while the decline in green innovation tends to increase the carbon emissions. In order to handle the grievous problem of environmental degradation, caused by the Film and Drama industry of China, this study suggests that adopting green practices in Film and Drama making, such as green filming, the use of hybrid vehicles, LED lights, and solar generator supplies, and perhaps Computer-Generated Imagery sets will ultimately contribute towards the improvement of the quality of the environment.",95299321,38,79,,

Evidence from China,"Yijian Du, Guoming Hao, Honghui Zhu",Sustainability,2025,"Under the background of uncertainty brought by the rapid development of AI, participation in AI standardisation is becoming the key for strategic emerging enterprises (SEEs) to break through and achieve sustainable development. This paper selects listed SEEs from the China Strategic Emerging Industries Composite Index jointly issued by China Securities Index Co., Ltd. and the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2017 as the initial sample. We collect 3430 observations from 380 companies spanning 2010 to 2023. This paper employs a two-way fixed effects model incorporating enterprise clustering. It thoroughly investigates and empirically tests how participation in AI standardisation affects the sustainable development of SEEs under uncertainty. It is found that participation in AI standardisation in the context of uncertainty has a significant positive effect on the sustainable development of SEEs, and this conclusion still holds after employing instrumental variables, difference-in-difference, and a series of robustness tests. Mechanism tests indicate that two transmission paths exist between participation in AI standardisation and the sustainable development of SEEs under uncertainty: digital technology innovation and the dynamic capabilities in the dimensions of learning and absorption as well as change and reconfiguration. However, the dynamic capabilities in the coordination and integration dimensions do not play a significant mediating role. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that participation in AI standardisation contributes more significantly to the sustainable development of SEEs that are not state-owned, face lower environmental and information uncertainty, and are under higher economic policy uncertainty. The findings enrich the research related to AI standardisation and firm sustainability and provide policy recommendations for the sustainable development of SEEs in the context of uncertainty.",291171055,1,54,,

This study aims to evaluate the impact of AI applications in enterprises on the growth of enterprise market value and the transmission mechanism of these impacts. Using an enterprise AI application level as the independent variable, a regression model is constructed to analyze the long-term and short-term market value of the enterprise. This study uses relevant data from Chinese listed companies from 2014 to 2023 for analysis. Findings show that for every 1% increase in AI application level, the enterprise market value increases by 0.03% and the enterprise value multiple increases by 0.44%. Increasing the level of AI application in enterprises will enhance their ability to implement low-carbon measures and investors’ expectations of corporate profits, thereby increasing the market value of enterprises. High-quality talent within the enterprise and market share can enhance the impact of these two mechanisms. The application of AI in enterprises has different impacts on different industries and companies of different sizes.

As the world faces mounting pressure to combat climate change, financial institutions and investors are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance sustainable investment strategies, assess environmental risks, and ensure transparency in green finance initiatives. This paper critically examines the role of AI in green financing, assessing whether it is a genuine catalyst for change or an overstated promise burdened by technological and regulatory limitations. AI-driven innovations are shaping green bond assessment, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scoring, carbon credit trading, and predictive climate risk modelling. These advancements highlight both opportunities and challenges in sustainable finance. AI's ability to process vast amounts of unstructured environmental data allows for improved decision-making. However, concerns regarding data bias, greenwashing, and the absence of standardised AI governance frameworks raise questions about its reliability and fairness. Machine learning models contribute to enhanced risk assessment and portfolio optimisation, yet regulatory inconsistencies and the opacity of AI decision-making processes often hinder their widespread adoption. Real world applications and case studies offer valuable insights into AI's effectiveness in driving green financial practices. Emerging trends, including AI-powered sustainability disclosures and blockchain-integrated AI systems, present promising solutions for greater transparency in green financing. This paper evaluates whether AI serves as a revolutionary enabler of sustainable finance or whether its potential is overstated, requiring stronger regulatory and ethical oversight to ensure meaningful impact.",288502011,0,24,,

 This study addresses the challenges posed by interwoven complexities that expose businesses to ESG (environmental, social and governance) risks. Specifically, the study aims to investigate and provide mechanisms to effectively use COSO’s (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) guidance in managing ESG-related risks.
 
 
 
 This study adopts a “combined approach,” integrating reductionistic risk management (COSO’s ERM) and holistic sustainability perspectives (India’s BRSR–Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report). It developed a worldwide transferable ESG risk management mechanism based on COSO’s and WBCSD’s ERM guidance, GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and Integrated Reporting standards. It then applied to BRSR to create a country-specific performance assessment tool for ESG-related risk management. This tool, which categorizes 55 risk-relevant disclosures into ESG dimensions, has a four-point scale developed through sustainability-related content analysis. The study is validated with machine learning algorithms and experts’ opinions to enhance the robustness of the findings. The tool is operationalized on three Indian companies.
 
 
 
 The study’s findings reveal a gap in existing mechanisms for supporting the effective use of ERM in managing ESG-related risks. The two-folded mechanism demonstrates its applicability globally while offering a tailored solution for India through the BRSR system. Application of the developed tool to three real-world use cases showcases its practical effectiveness in addressing and mitigating ESG risks.
 
 
 
 This study offers a novel approach to assessing ESG-related risks. The two-folded mechanism adds originality to existing literature. Additionally, validating the “holistic and reductionistic” approach with machine learning algorithms enhances the originality and innovation of the study, providing a valuable resource for diverse stakeholders involved in decision-making related to ESG risks.

The mechanisms through which AI contributes to ESG outcomes cluster around three interrelated domains: firm-level capabilities and characteristics; technological and operational mediators; and regional and contextual factors. Key contributions of AI include improvements in data processing and information governance, innovation, mitigation of greenwashing, facilitation of digital transformation, enhanced ESG operational efficiency, and stronger internal control mechanisms. However, the effectiveness of AI in improving ESG outcomes remains highly context dependent. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI-enabled ESG transformation by offering a structured synthesis of existing research and outlining a future research agenda.",297331146,0,63,,

Miao",Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia,2025,"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports are essential for assessing sustainability, regulatory compliance, and financial transparency. However, these documents are typically long, multimodal, and structurally complex, combining dense text, tables, figures, and layout-sensitive semantics. Existing AI systems often struggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no dedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we introduce MMESGBench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted to evaluate multimodal understanding and reasoning across multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a human-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates candidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting textual, tabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an LLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of each QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop validation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure quality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs derived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types and three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as single-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained multimodal evidence. Initial experiments validate that multimodal and retrieval-augmented models substantially outperform text-only baselines.

ESG, encompassing environmental, social, and governance factors, serves as a critical tool for evaluating the sustainable development performance of enterprises. ESG ratings provide essential data for research and strategic decision-making on ESG initiatives. Originating from socially responsible investment in the 1960s, the concept of ESG has evolved through four distinct stages: origin, development, establishment, and rapid development. This paper begins by outlining the concept of carbon neutrality, detailing its emergence, timeline, and current status. It then traces the evolution of ESG.

The Role of Human Capital Structure,"Yingying Qi, Guohua Yu",Sustainability,2025,"Existing research has focused chiefly on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on economic growth. This study developed an AI dictionary using machine learning methods. Based on data from 3646 Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed A-share companies from 2011 to 2022 and a panel mediation effect model, the relationships between AI application, human capital structure adjustment, and corporate ESG performance were examined. Theoretical research suggests that when corporates adopt AI, demand for high-skilled labor will increase while some low-skilled positions will be replaced. This leads to optimization of the human capital structure, which in turn improves corporate ESG performance. The results of the mechanism examination show that enhancing corporate ESG performance through AI use is achieved by modifying the human capital structure. Analysis of heterogeneity finds that for non-state-owned, large-sized, and non-technology-intensive corporates, the impact of AI applications on corporate ESG performance is more pronounced. This research further deepens the understanding of AI’s role in the corporate governance process at the micro-corporate level and offers suggestions to promote the development of AI technology.",295241595,0,68,,

However, such metrics often fail to accurately capture the synergistic interplay among the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) pillars, leading to an inadequate reflection of the actual implementation status of corporate sustainability strategies. To address this research gap, this study introduces the ""ESG Coupling Coordination Degree"" as a core evaluation metric to systematically investigate the mechanism through which the level of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and the degree of digital transformation influence corporate ESG coordinated development. Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2023, this research first constructs a coupling coordination degree model to measure the level of corporate ESG coordinated development and reveals its temporal evolution characteristics. The empirical results indicate that: the overall ESG coupling coordination degree of firms shows a steady upward trend, albeit with significant industry and regional disparities. Both the depth of digital transformation and the breadth of AI application exert a significant positive impact on corporate ESG coordinated development. This mechanism operates by enhancing the efficiency of internal information flows, which in turn promotes the balanced development of environmental management systems, social responsibility fulfillment, and corporate governance structures. Further analysis reveals that this synergistic effect is more pronounced in firms located in the eastern region and in technology-intensive industries, whereas firms with weaker digital infrastructure exhibit greater potential for improvement in ESG coordination. These findings provide empirical evidence and policy implications for policymakers aiming to foster the deep integration of the digital economy and sustainable development.",292411431,0,4,,

From a systems perspective, this study developed a dynamic learning game model that integrates a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function, an AI-enabled abatement function, and institutional constraints to analyze firms’ cleaner production and technology adoption under simultaneous budgetary and emission constraints. Empirically, we drew on panel data of 3404 Chinese A-share listed firms from 2013 to 2023 and employ a two-way fixed-effect model to examine the effect of AI empowerment on CEP. The results showed that AI significantly improves CEP overall, though its effect is potentially constrained by energy rebound effects. Robustness checks using alternative measures and specifications confirmed the reliability of the findings and further indicated that AI’s abatement effect became stronger after 2018, consistent with technological maturity and institutional improvement. Mechanism analysis suggests two plausible pathways: (1) improving ESG performance and strengthening environmental governance; and (2) stimulating green innovation to support low-carbon technology development and application. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that AI’s effects are more evident in regions with higher marketization, in private firms, and in non-pollution-intensive industries. By contrast, firms led by executives with overseas experience tend to exhibit weaker effects, a pattern consistent with institutional fit and localization considerations. This study contributes to cleaner production theory by highlighting firm-level mechanisms of AI-enabled carbon governance while offering practical insights for low-carbon transitions and digital decarbonization strategies in developing economies.",292131740,0,140,,

However, due to various reasons, significant discrepancies have emerged in ESG ratings for the same company across different institutions, and this growing divergence in ESG ratings has increasingly drawn the attention of scholars. Studying the differences in ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) ratings is of great significance. This not only helps to understand the root causes of differences, improve the objectivity, consistency, and comparability of ratings, but also helps users better understand the meaning and limitations of rating results. It is beneficial for investors to understand the focus of different ratings and develop more effective investment strategies. It can promote rated companies to improve the quality and transparency of ESG-related information disclosure. It can also provide a reference for regulatory agencies and policymakers, identify market failures and potential risks, and promote the development of more unified standards and frameworks. At the same time, this study can also promote the in-depth development of relevant academic research and theories. Based on this, this study systematically reviews the relevant literature on ESG rating divergence, focusing on its existence, causes, influencing factors, and impacts. The study finds that, in addition to the widespread existence of rating divergence in corporate ESG performance, scholars also disagree on the measurement and methods of this divergence. The reasons for rating divergence are mainly that ESG is a qualitative indicator; top-level design, intermediate calculations, and bottom-level data collection across multiple stages exacerbate divergence; and controversies in practice further deepen divergence, among others. The influencing factors and impact effects of ESG rating divergence are diverse. Given the existence of ESG rating divergence, all parties should treat ESG ratings with caution.

However, sustainable management of TSW is challenging as it contains hazardous chemicals. Implementing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices can support managing TSW towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, it is not easy to implement ESG practices for TSW management since numerous challenges exist in the system. To assist TSW management through ESG implementation, it is imperative to investigate the interactions among challenges and mitigation strategies. However, the existing decision‐making models cannot deal with the uncertainty and vagueness on a border scale during interaction evaluation and alternatives ranking. Additionally, there is a shortage of scientific works on ESG practices in emerging economies. Therefore, this study, for the first time, offers an integrated novel Dombi t‐norm and Dombi t‐conorm grounded interval valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) Delphi, an extended IVFFSs‐weighted influence non‐liner Gause system (WINGS), and novel IVFFSs‐TODIM approach which is utterly lacking in the present literature. Also, the study offers a strategic roadmap to understand the interlinkage of findings with SDGs. The results of the IVFFSs‐WINGS analysis confirmed that the “Lack of solid waste management policy” is the most critical challenge for ESG implementation. Further, IVFFSs‐TODIM analysis confirmed that the “Policy development for TSW management complying with ESG and SDGs” is the top ESG challenges mitigation strategy for TSW management.

After increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix from 26% to 85%, in line with the 2050 targets for the Spanish economy, the same shock results in a 0.24% fall in GDP on impact, and the recovery is faster: the present discounted value of the full GDP response is reduced by 65%. The three main conclusions that we draw from this exercise are: i) an increase in the share of renewables makes the economy less vulnerable to shocks in international prices of brown energy inputs; ii) this vulnerability reduction is less than proportional: dividing the share of brown energy by approximately five only reduceds the size of the effects on GDP by between 21% and 65%; and iii) the main statistic that determines how much the vulnerability is reduced is not the share of brown energy inputs, but the degree to which final energy prices respond to the shock to brown energy prices.",275470919,15,77,,

These digital agreements automate trade settlements based on predefined conditions, expediting contract execution while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, AI-powered algorithmic trading enhances market responsiveness, enabling energy companies to make data-driven decisions in real-time. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning models, traders can optimize portfolio management, anticipate supply chain disruptions, and manage price volatility more effectively. Moreover, blockchain fosters trust among stakeholders by providing a tamper-proof audit trail of transactions, enhancing regulatory compliance, and reducing operational inefficiencies. The integration of AI with blockchain-enabled trading platforms allows for automated risk assessment, fraud detection, and enhanced liquidity management. These innovations collectively contribute to a more resilient and adaptive energy trading ecosystem, accommodating the growing complexity of global oil and gas markets. Despite these advantages, challenges such as regulatory uncertainties, interoperability issues, and cybersecurity risks persist. The successful implementation of blockchain and AI in energy trading requires standardized frameworks, industry-wide collaboration, and robust cybersecurity measures.

Design/methodology/approach The present study is a panel data approach with a sample of the top 100 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)-listed non-financial firms covering the years 2019–2022. Appropriate panel data models have been used to investigate the association between ESG disclosure and financial performance, followed by an instrumental variable regression model to address endogeneity. Further, the panel data interaction effect model has been used to examine the moderating impact. Findings The results favour the value-enhancing function of ESG disclosure. Of the three ESG components, only the G factor affects firm performance significantly. The interaction effect model suggests that the link between ESG disclosure and financial performance is moderated by industry. However, this effect is greater for less sensitive industries. The results are robust to endogeneity. Originality/value The study’s novelty lies in the use of the integrated “Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics”, which has not been previously used in any study to assess the ESG disclosure of corporates. To further distinguish itself, the moderating impact of high and less climate-sensitive industry firms on the ESG-financial performance link, which remains unexplored in the fast-emerging nation of India, is looked into.",275028814,12,47,,

The objective of this study is to identify the main environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators from the literature and analyze their impact on corporate company performances, as well as a conceptual structure that supports the understanding of these indicators. A systematic literature review was applied to raise and analyze relevant works in the field, following the guidelines of the Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). We identified and categorized the main indicators for each of the ESG dimensions, as well as the corporate performance (CP) variables impacted by ESG performance, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of their interrelations. Our results indicate that financial performance indicators must be assessed from a long-term perspective, as short-term analyses may show negative relationships with ESG performance. However, for nonfinancial aspects, the relationship with ESG performance is consistently positive across all time horizons. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework that advances the ESG literature by establishing explicit connections between ESG dimensions and corporate performance variables. This framework categorizes CP into four key areas—financial performance, market and risk perception, strategic positioning, and capital structure—providing a structured approach for evaluating ESG impacts. Our study contributes to both theory and practice, offering insights that support corporate decision-making and sustainability strategies.",286903535,12,111,,

Zariyawati",Business Strategy &amp; Development,2024,"Geopolitical risk (GPR) presents a profound challenge to firms, particularly in regions with persistent political instability. In Eastern Europe, where conflicts like the Russia–Ukraine war heighten uncertainty, firms face immediate financial threats and long‐term strategic vulnerabilities. This study examines the impact of GPR on firm performance, focusing on the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices as a resilience mechanism. Using a comprehensive dataset of 1360 publicly listed firms across Poland, Russia, and Ukraine from 2014 to 2023, the analysis employs a base panel data regression model, followed by a two‐step generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to account for endogeneity and ensure robustness. The findings reveal a significant negative relationship between GPR and firm performance, measured by return on assets (ROA). Firms exposed to higher geopolitical risks exhibit weaker profitability. However, firms with stronger ESG performance demonstrate greater resilience, as the GMM results show that ESG engagement moderates the adverse effects of GPR on profitability. This suggests that ESG initiatives enhance adaptive capacity in volatile geopolitical environments. In terms of policy implications, ESG should be promoted as a key strategy for firms operating in politically unstable regions. Governments and regulatory bodies may consider mandatory ESG disclosures and incentivizing sustainability practices to help firms mitigate external risks, improve financial resilience, and attract stable investment. Aligning corporate strategies with global ESG standards is essential to ensuring business sustainability amid ongoing geopolitical threats.",280107336,12,51,,

A quasi-natural experiment from 281 Chinese cities,"Wei Shao, Ke Yang, Zebin Jin",Frontiers in Energy Research,2023,"China’s emissions trading system is often cited as a model for developing countries using market-based means to solve pollution problems, but few have objectively assessed the solution from a productivity perspective. Therefore, in this study, the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of 281 prefecture-level cities was calculated by using the DEA–Malmquist method, and the policy effects were evaluated by setting up quasi-natural experiments. The results show that the carbon emissions trading system has a positive contribution to GTFP; when facing a more compatible carbon trading system, enterprises will choose two paths: innovation compensation and industrial upgrading to improve GTFP, so as to get rid of the cost constraints caused by carbon emission control; the policy effect of the carbon emissions trading system varies significantly in different regions. In the economically developed eastern region, the effect of policy implementation is relatively significant, while the effect of policy implementation in the western region is not significant. Further analysis shows that as a market-based environmental policy, the incentive effect of the carbon trading system relies on a perfect market system.

M. Butt",Administrative Sciences,2025,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of environmental disclosure and corporate governance on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia. This study highlights that sustainable practices are transparent with financial objectives using the religious framework of Islamic finance. This research is based on Worldwide Vision 2030, which covers sustainable development and promotes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, as well as corporate governance factors, such as board composition and Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs). We use a hybrid approach for our findings, with a dataset spanning 2011–2023 for the quantitative analysis and 20 semi-structured analyses conducted for a qualitative approach that aligns with objectives. We found that environmental disclosure boosts profits and stakeholder trust. Corporate governance structures, such as environmental boards and sustainability committees, improve the environmental disclosure of financial performance in Islamic banks. In this positive interaction, specialized governance drives Sharia-compliant sustainability initiatives. SSBs help Islamic banks integrate sustainability and meet religious and ESG environmental standards. Board diversity and dedication in the sustainability committee both play important roles in enhancing environmental disclosure practices; in return, these improved financial performances. The interaction of environmental disclosure and board environmental expertise has a positive impact on the overall performance, which indicates that governance structure supports sustainability-related decision-making, aligning with transparency. This study suggests that Islamic banks standardize ESG frameworks, improve board environmental expertise, and invest in real-time sustainability reporting digital solutions. Saudi Islamic banks can lead regional and global sustainable banking by adopting these strategies to align with global sustainability trends, improve financial performance, and meet ethical finance expectations.",284124828,12,36,,

Using 10 years of panel data across resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service sectors, the analysis employs the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for robust estimation. The results reveal a positive overall effect of ESG practices on ROA, with significant differences across industries. The study uses the categorization of resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service industries to examine the differential effects of ESG factors on ROA. However, environmental scores do not significantly impact ROA, suggesting uniform effects across industries. Social scores enhance ROA without notable industry‐specific differences, while governance scores show varying effects, indicating sector‐specific drivers of profitability. The analysis also highlights the moderating effects of industry categories on the ESG–ROA relationship, suggesting that the impact of ESG practices varies across different sectors. The study also considers the economic effects of COVID‐19, highlighting its marginal impact on ROA and the need for resilient financial strategies. However, the moderating effect of COVID‐19 on this relationship was not significant, indicating limited variation in the ESG–ROA dynamics during the pandemic period except in the governance model.

As inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of consumers diminishes, leading to increased food prices and potentially exacerbating food insecurity. This research aims to quantify the relationship between inflation and food security indicators, such as availability, access, utilization, and stability of food supplies. By employing time-series data and econometric techniques, the model captures the dynamic interactions between inflation rates, food prices, and socioeconomic factors affecting food security. The model incorporates key variables, including consumer price index (CPI), food inflation, income levels, and unemployment rates, to analyze their collective impact on food security across different demographics. The findings indicate that rising inflation significantly correlates with higher food prices, disproportionately affecting low-income households and vulnerable populations. This relationship highlights the necessity of understanding inflation's broader implications on food accessibility, especially in regions where food security is already a pressing issue. Future research directions are proposed, focusing on policy interventions aimed at stabilizing food prices and enhancing food security. Potential strategies include price controls, subsidies for staple foods, and targeted social safety nets for low-income households. Additionally, the study suggests further examination of supply chain factors contributing to food price volatility, such as transportation costs and global market dynamics, which can exacerbate inflation's effects on food security. This research contributes to the literature on food security by providing empirical evidence of inflation's impact on food accessibility and identifying critical areas for policy intervention.

As fluctuations in trade policies—such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies—directly impact food prices and market stability, this model provides a structured framework for assessing these variables’ interdependencies. By integrating data on trade flows, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, the model quantifies the effects of protective and liberalized trade measures on both local and international food markets. This approach allows for identifying trends in pricing volatility linked to policy shifts, thereby offering insights into areas vulnerable to trade disruptions and external economic shocks. The resilience of the food supply chain is measured by evaluating metrics such as delivery times, supplier diversity, and inventory levels across regions affected by trade policy changes. The findings emphasize that trade barriers can result in price spikes, delays, and supply shortages, while open trade policies generally support market flexibility and pricing stability. Additionally, the model incorporates economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment rates, which correlate with food demand and purchasing power, thereby further influencing price and supply chain stability. Future research could leverage this model to develop adaptive strategies that strengthen supply chain resilience under various global trade conditions. Suggested adaptations include diversifying suppliers, increasing inventory buffers, and enhancing predictive analytics for better demand forecasting. By integrating these adaptive measures, stakeholders can mitigate adverse effects on food accessibility and affordability in both developed and emerging economies.

Walsh",Business Strategy and the Environment,2024,"This study delves into the pressing challenge of achieving carbon neutrality (CN) operational status among firms, with a specific focus on the moderating impact of emission scopes. We use mixed methods and ambidexterity and resource dependence theories to examine the relationships between four cooperation kinds (exploration‐focused, exploitation‐focused, resonance‐based, and governance‐centric) and firms' CN operating status. We also examine how three emission scopes affect cooperation and CN operating status. Our comprehensive research, based on primary and secondary data from 267 organizations, enhances our knowledge of how cooperation helps CNs achieve operational status. We find that stakeholder collaboration improves CN objectives. We found subtle correlations between collaboration types and emission scopes. Governance‐centric cooperation has a substantial interaction effect on scope 1 emissions, demonstrating its effectiveness in controlling emissions from owned or regulated sources. As the two emissions interact, the resonance‐based cooperation emphasizes the necessity of common values and beliefs between enterprises and stakeholders. With scope 3 emissions, exploitation‐focused cooperation emphasizes resource usage in emission management across the value chain and transportation. Exploration‐focused collaboration interacts with CN operational status for all three emission scopes, highlighting the importance of collaboration with research institutions, startups, and stakeholders in exploring emerging technologies and driving systemic changes for emission mitigation. Our study shows that stakeholder participation is crucial to CN operating status, especially for varied emission scopes. This research sheds light on collaborative strategy development and its importance in tackling varied emission scopes. Our research provides important contributions to the field, but future studies should understand its limits and examine the complexities of CN operational status and cooperation in other situations to increase knowledge.",270222127,10,91,,

However, they also pose significant challenges to long-term sustainability. While the existing literature provides valuable insights into their influence, a broader scope is necessary to reflect their role in advancing sustainable finance. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of 2,446 publications from the Web of Science (1996–2024) to map the evolving nexus between emerging technologies and finance. Our findings reveal an expanding research landscape, with key themes including the application of emerging technologies in solving financial problems, the integration of technologies with behavioural and regulatory frameworks, financial innovation for promoting development, risk management and financial stability, digital currencies and blockchain, digital transformation challenges, and sustainable finance. The analysis highlights the dual nature of emerging technologies: while they enhance financial efficiency, transparency, and inclusion, and offer significant opportunities to advance sustainable finance, they also introduce risks such as cybersecurity threats, algorithmic bias, regulatory challenges, and critical barriers to long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, we propose a research agenda prioritizing ethical governance, stress-testing AI models under economic crises, securing decentralized systems, mitigating greenwashing risks, and fostering globally aligned regulatory standards. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to tackle ethical, security, and inclusivity concerns. It is imperative for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions to align technological innovation with sustainability objectives to ensure that advancements contribute to the development of an equitable, resilient, and inclusive financial ecosystem.",286816896,10,484,,

Yet, established technology adoption theories offer limited tools for characterizing business AI integration and analyzing its effects. These primarily focus on the factors facilitating or hindering adoption, rather than on adoption patterns and impacts. This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to address this key gap and applies it to the case of the ESG rating industry. ESG raters play a pivotal role in sustainable finance, providing metrics that guide investment decisions globally. However, little is known about the extent and nature of their AI usage and its implications. Through a mixed‐methods approach combining the analysis of job postings, patent filings, research publications, and corporate websites, we examine AI adoption among major ESG raters. Our investigation explores the specific AI technologies employed, their functional applications, the innovations developed, the intensity of AI integration, and the potential impacts of raters' AI adoption. Our results reveal widespread and growing AI adoption across the industry. Our findings show that raters extensively leverage Natural Language Processing to streamline data collection, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, they have pioneered Machine Learning innovations that significantly expand their sustainability assessment capabilities in various domains. These findings mark a considerable departure from prior academic and gray literature that characterized major ESG raters as having minimal AI use, prompting critical questions regarding the implications of this technological transformation for ESG ratings' reliability, transparency, and potential biases.",281277870,10,131,,

This motivates researchers to continuously add new features to the datasets for the credit risk prediction (CRP). However, adding new features can easily lead to missing of the data.Design/methodology/approachBased on the gaps summarized from the literature in CRP, this study first introduces the approaches to the building of datasets and the framing of the algorithmic models. Then, this study tests the interpolation effects of the algorithmic model in three artificial datasets with different missing rates and compares its predictability before and after the interpolation in a real dataset with the missing data in irregular time-series.FindingsThe algorithmic model of the time-decayed long short-term memory (TD-LSTM) proposed in this study can monitor the missing data in irregular time-series by capturing more and better time-series information, and interpolating the missing data efficiently. Moreover, the algorithmic model of Deep Neural Network can be used in the CRP for the datasets with the missing data in irregular time-series after the interpolation by the TD-LSTM.Originality/valueThis study fully validates the TD-LSTM interpolation effects and demonstrates that the predictability of the dataset after interpolation is improved.

By examining three experimental cases varying the level of environmental disclosure, we evaluate the investment judgments of professional (Study 1) and private German investors (Study 2). Primarily, we investigate whether traditional, commonly disclosed environmental information affects investor judgments. Furthermore, we explore the effects of linking non-financial reporting elements to quantitative financial measures through the EU taxonomy by adding taxonomy indicators. Specifically, we operationalized the case where companies fall into a category of poor environmental performance by taxonomy classification. We find that only traditional environmental disclosure in combination with standardized taxonomy-aligned information (below average), influences the investment judgment. However, professional investors exhibit a significantly negative response, while private investors show a significantly positive reaction when constraining reporting flexibility through the inclusion of standardized taxonomy measures with poor performance. Consequently, we conclude that the connection between non-financial reporting elements and quantitative standardized financial measures enhances transparency for professional investors. Private investors, on the other hand, reward additional taxonomy-aligned environmental information irrespective of its content. This implies that environmental information generally conveys positive signals to private investors, but uncertainty in investment judgment can be assumed.",272411741,8,81,,

Senaya,World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,2024,"Introduction: A recurrent trend has been financial literacy to play a significant role in enhancing effective and sustainable investment decision making, and stability of the economy. This paper explores the complex connection between financial literacy, how it links to sustainable finance, and investments, with much emphasis on the importance of increasing people’s understanding of finance so that they make more sustainable decisions on how to use their money. The challenge gives the research a broad context by demonstrating how financial literacy increasingly influences personal savings, corporate actions, and global economics in general, and how it will impact these dynamics further, especially with the emergence of growing environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Materials and Methods: This paper provides a review of extant literature from multiple disciplines, government and policy documents, and research articles. The approach adopted in the research entails identification of relevant premier scholarly articles, financial sector reports, and economic data to achieve a conceptual understanding of the subject. A number of databases and sources have been employed to collect information regarding initiatives in financial literacy, trends of sustainable investment products and their economic impact within the demographical and geographical context. Results: This study also show positive significant relationship between financial literacy levels and sustainable investment behaviour. A study established that people with an improved level of understanding of financial matters will likely plan financially, demonstrate concern in sustainable investments, and make the right decisions consistent with ESG standards. At corporate level, firms with financial literacy executives show improved capability in addressing rigorous sustainable finance odd and incorporating ECG factors in their strategic operations. Additionally, this work recognizes crucial shortcomings in financial literacy of adults and demonstrates internal findings concerning imbalance in financial literacy in relation to the socioeconomic status and the need for focused educational programs. Discussion: In this respect, it becomes evident that financial literacy is a prerequisite on which the future pillars of economic development depend.

The present study estimates the factors that help drive the global green bond markets, such as energy prices, gold prices, and green energy stocks. The study has applied Quantile Autoregressive Lagged Approach (QARDL) and Quantile Granger Causality test to estimate the causal relationship among the variables for January 2010 and June 2021. The QARDL findings reveal that for all the quantiles, the error correction term is statistically significant with the predicted negative sign. This confirms the existence of a strong long-run equilibrium relationship between the relevant variables and the green bonds market on a global level. The findings revealed that gold and energy prices have a lower effect on the green bonds market on every quantile, and also from the low to medium quantiles, respectively. While at the same time, the green energy stocks have an increasing effect on the green bonds market at higher quantiles. The results of the causal examination using Granger-causality in quantiles show a bi-directional causal relationship between the green bonds, energy prices, gold prices, and green energy stocks in the world economy.",22071513,36,91,,

Online bullying, hate speech, and harassment often result in emotional distress, anxiety, and even depression among targeted individuals. Furthermore, toxic comments can foster an atmosphere of hostility, division, and polarization within communities, contributing to the erosion of civil discourse and the spread of misinformation. Toxicity classification is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the level of toxicity or offensiveness in a given text. Embedding methods play a crucial role in toxicity classification by transforming textual data into numerical representations that capture semantic and contextual information. This paper explores the efficiency of different embedding approaches for toxicity classification in text, posts or reviews. Particularly, the study compares efficiency of conventional approaches such as CountVectorizer as well as TF-IDF with state-of-the-art approaches including Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT and also GPT3. A large dataset of toxic comments, reviews, or posts is used to evaluate the efficiency of these approaches, employing common metrics like F1-score. The outcomes suggest that GPT3 embedding surpasses all various other approaches accomplishing the greatest F1-score 98.9, followed by Bert and Word2Vec. These results recommend that utilizing pre-trained contextualized embedding can considerably enhance the precision of toxicity classification models.",272744010,32,7,,

It therefore uses the dataset pertaining to China from most recent time-series – covering the period spanning from the years of 1990 to 2020, by employing the Morlet Wavelet Analysis technique. The empirical findings of the wavelet power spectrum reveal that green finance GF and ER are vulnerable in the short- and long-run, and the short-run, respectively. At the same time, no vulnerability has been observed in the GDP, PR, and CO2 emissions. In addition to this, the wavelet coherence also reveals the bidirectional causal association that exists between GF-CO2 and ER-CO2, but only in the short run. It must also be taken into consideration that the causal influence of CO2 is deemed to be greater than the GF and ER, respectively. Besides this, a bidirectional causal nexus also exists between the GDP and CO2 emissions, only in the long run. Furthermore, the association between the economic growths follows both the phase and antiphase associations. Moreover, the study also reveals that there is no significant causal link between the PR and CO2 emissions. The results emphasize that the significance of green finance investment will tend to increase with strict policy implications, stabilization or minimization of economic risk and political risk.

 Requirements engineering (RE) faces challenges due to the handling of increasingly complex software systems. These challenges can be addressed using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Given that GenAI‐based RE has not been systematically analyzed in detail, this review examines the related research, focusing on trends, methodologies, challenges, and future work directions.
 
 
 
 A systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis is used to comprehensively review 238 articles published from 2019 to 2025 and available from major academic databases.
 
 
 
 Although generative pretrained transformer models dominate current applications (67.3% of studies), the research focus remains unevenly distributed across RE phases, with analysis (30.0%) and elicitation (22.1%) receiving the most attention and management (6.8%) remaining underexplored. Three core challenges—reproducibility (66.8%), hallucinations (63.4%), and interpretability (57.1%)—form a tightly interlinked triad affecting trust and consistency, and strong correlations ( co‐occurrence) indicate that these challenges must be addressed holistically. Industrial adoption remains nascent, with > 90% of studies corresponding to early‐stage development and only 1.3% reaching production‐level integration. Evaluation practices show maturity gaps, limited tool/dataset availability, and fragmented benchmarking approaches.
 
 
 
 Despite the transformative potential of GenAI‐based RE, several barriers hinder its practical adoption. The strong correlations among core challenges demand specialized architectures targeting interdependencies rather than isolated solutions. The limited real‐world deployment reflects systemic bottlenecks in generalizability, data quality, and scalable evaluation methods. Successful adoption requires coordinated development across technical robustness, methodological maturity, and governance integration. A multiphase research roadmap emphasizing evaluation infrastructure strengthening, governance‐aware development, and industrial‐scale standardization is proposed.

By examining and contrasting global and European contexts, the research highlights ESG’s critical role in shaping the economic dimensions of sustainability across different regulatory environments. The results provide essential insights for stakeholders aiming to enhance corporate value through responsible business practices.Design/methodology/approachWe adopt a quantitative fixed-effects panel regression analysis for ESG performance and intangible asset and intellectual capital values. The correlations between these variables are explored both globally and in the European Union using 1,034 observations from 502 F&B companies.FindingsGlobally, higher ESG performance corresponds to lower intangible asset values, a trend not observed in the European Union. Further, high ESG performance is associated with a decrease in intellectual capital value, suggesting that internal organisational efforts in this area should be rewarded in terms of short-term value.Originality/valueThis study provides a new understanding of the relationship between ESG performance, intellectual capital, and the F&B industry operating environment, highlighting the complexity and challenges associated with integrating ESG practices.",273000177,24,65,,

Original KCDWU has a more prominent adaptive property but ignores intra‐class and inter‐class distances in the clustering process, resulting in the possibility of inaccurate identification of class features and cluster structure of data, which compromises the clustering effect. Therefore, we improve the automatic K‐means clustering based on the Calinski–Harabasz index, thus achieving a clustering output for improved results. We also scrutinize representative five single classification models and six ensemble learning models for credit scoring prediction. We empirically test the superior performance of ensemble learning models and identify the best model CatBoost by comparing them based on multiple evaluation indicators. Empirical results reveal that the SHAP method conforms well to CatBoost and delivers a global and local interpretation of the predictions.

There may be environmental costs to using conventional energy from fossil fuels to meet increased energy demand. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the link between energy efficiency and energy transition along with additional control variables like research and development expenditures, trade, and gross domestic product for the top 10 emerging countries between 1990 and 2021. To study the case of these targeted economies, the authors use panel data and novel panel data econometrics techniques for a long-run relationship like the MMQR to observe changes over time between the variables, which is useful in the empirical evidence. The models’ primary findings are as follows: The panel cointegration tests confirm log-run associations among the targeted variables. Energy efficiency has the largest influence on the energy transition. The control variables like RDR and TRA decrease renewable energy consumption in the targeted economies. The findings also support the notion that GDP drives renewable energy consumption in the leading emerging economies.

This paper empirically examines the impact of corporate application of AI technology on corporate ESG performance using a sample of 4858 listed companies in China from 2007 to 2022. The study finds that: (1) corporate application of AI technology can significantly enhance corporate ESG performance, and this conclusion still holds after a series of endogeneity treatments and robustness tests; (2) mechanism analysis shows that the degree of corporate digitalization has a positive moderating effect in the process of AI technology affecting corporate ESG performance. The channel analysis shows that the application of AI technology can enhance environmental (E) performance by strengthening corporate green technology innovation, social (S) performance by improving corporate philanthropic responsibility, and overall ESG performance with the above two sub-items as the main aspects. However, AI technology also weakens the effectiveness of corporate internal control, which leads to a decline in corporate governance (G) performance; (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that AI technology promotes ESG more significantly in more competitive industries and tech-nology-intensive firms, and more significantly in the eastern and central regions than in the western and northeastern regions, and that large- and medium-sized firms are similarly superior to small-sized firms, while medium-sized firms have more room for upward mobility than large-sized firms, which embody a higher promotion effect than large enterprises. This paper provides theoretical evidence that enterprises apply AI technology to improve ESG performance and empirical support around investing in ESG practices and promoting ESG development.",283119010,20,32,,

The authors use three different constructs of credit risk, namely the probability of default which is a forward-looking quantification, a book value-based infection ratio and independent opinion of credit ratings, to assess the relationship with human capital efficiency. Different macro and firm-specific control variables are introduced, including a dummy for technological innovation and a GARCH-based measure of oil price volatility.FindingsThe findings of this study reveal that human capital efficiency is negatively related to the credit risk profile and banks with higher human capital efficiency tend to have lower credit risk. These results remained robust across the three definitions of credit risk used in this study.Originality/valueThis study is unique in exploring the impact of human capital efficiency on credit risk because credit risk is not only a central determinant of bank performance but also can trigger a systemic panic. Therefore, it is vital to assess its relationship with human capital efficiency. The different constructs of credit risk are innovative with reference to human capital.

One such topic is central bank digital currency (CBDC), which is attracting attention from the international community. The complex nature of this project means that it must be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences, such as financial instability. We propose the use of different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to better understand central banks’ stance towards CBDC, analyzing a set of central bank discourses from 2016 to 2022. We do this using traditional techniques, such as dictionary-based methods, and two large language models (LLMs), namely Bert and ChatGPT, concluding that LLMs better reflect the stance identified by human experts. In particular, we observe that ChatGPT exhibits a higher degree of alignment because it can capture subtler information than BERT. Our study suggests that LLMs are an effective tool to improve sentiment measurements for policy-specific texts, though they are not infallible and may be subject to new risks, like higher sensitivity to the length of texts, and prompt engineering.",265019928,20,100,,

However, this evolution also brings heightened exposure to fraud, data misuse, and systemic vulnerabilities that can undermine trust in digital health ecosystems. Ensuring that risk controls are not only effective but also explainable is increasingly vital for fostering accountability and regulatory compliance. This study explores a framework that integrates explainable machine learning, particularly SHAP-constrained gradient boosting, with layered governance mechanisms such as policy-based access control, audit trails, and chargeback mitigation. The objective is to balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, providing healthcare providers, regulators, and financial intermediaries with transparent insights into payment risk patterns. By embedding explainability into fraud detection and transaction monitoring, stakeholders can enhance decision-making, ensure fairness, and strengthen patient and provider trust. Furthermore, the inclusion of auditability and traceability supports compliance with evolving data protection regulations, while policy-driven access management reduces insider threats. Chargeback mitigation mechanisms provide an additional safeguard for consumers and healthcare organizations, reducing financial losses and disputes. Together, these risk controls contribute to a secure, transparent, and resilient digital health payment infrastructure.

Galán",Documento de trabajo,2024,"The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) has become a very important macroprudential tool to strengthen banks’ resilience. However, there is still limited evidence of its impact on lending over the cycle. Using data of 170 banks in 25 European Union countries, we provide a comprehensive assessment of how the CCyB release during the pandemic and its earlier accumulation impacted lending activity. We find that the CCyB has significant effects on lending, but that these effects are highly dependent on banks’ capitalization levels and, more importantly, on their headroom over regulatory requirements. We show that the release of the CCyB in response to the pandemic had a positive impact on lending, especially for banks with the lowest headroom over requirements, and that this effect was larger than the negative impact of its previous accumulation. While the CCyB accumulation had a short-term negative impact on lending for the most capital-constrained banks, this effect quickly diluted due to their enhanced solvency position, potentially allowing them to lower their cost of equity. Our results provide evidence of the benefits of the CCyB, especially in supporting lending during adverse events, while emphasising the need for policymakers to consider the heterogeneous effects across banks when deploying this tool.",272816609,17,86,,

Drawing on multiple theoretical frameworks, our empirical models employ firm fixed‐effects estimators to analyze an unbalanced panel dataset comprising 2226 firm‐year observations spanning 14 years. Our findings are three‐fold. First, our primary evidence reveals that both ESG disclosure and FinTech adoption have a statistically significant positive relationship with carbon performance. Second, we provide robust evidence that FinTech enhances the effectiveness of ESG disclosure by improving transparency, reducing information asymmetry, and facilitating access to green financial resources. Third, we find that carbon tax policies moderate these relationships, with firms in high‐regulation environments experiencing stronger positive effects. Overall, our results suggest that FinTech acts as an enabler, amplifying the impact of ESG practices on corporate carbon performance. Our findings are robust to various control mechanisms, alternative measures, and potential endogeneities.

If GenAI-run investment decisions from most firms are heavily coordinated, they could all give a “sell” signal simultaneously, triggering market crashes. Likewise, simultaneous “buy” signals from GenAI-run investment decisions could cause market bubbles with algorithmically inflated prices. In this way, coordinated actions from LLMs introduce systemic risk into the global financial system. Existing risk analysis for GenAI focuses on endogenous risk from model performance. In comparison, exogenous risk from external factors like macroeconomic changes, natural disasters, or sudden regulatory changes, is understudied. This research fills the gap by creating a framework for measuring exogenous (systemic) risk from LLMs acting in the stock trading system. This research develops a concrete, quantitative framework to understand the systemic risk brought by using GenAI in stock investment by measuring the covariance between LLM stock price predictions across three industries (technology, automobiles, and communications) produced by eight large language models developed across the United States, Europe, and China.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the changes in the traditional approach of sovereign debt managers in the face of the pursued climate policy and different scenarios of climate liabilities for 2050. We follow a novel three-fold research approach: 1) assessment of the estimated level of current climate liabilities based on the Fiscal Risk Matrix; 2) performing forward-looking climate debt projections over the timeframe 2025-2050 for the EU countries; 3) conducting case study research on EU countries, to identify the sovereign climate debt management activities undertaken so far and to define a series of good-practice guidelines. Findings indicate a growing role of the climate financial mechanisms in sovereign debt management. In particular, our climate scenario approach reveals those scenarios in which a country’s fiscal position indicators are more vulnerable from the standpoint of rising public expenditure due to the country’s inability to manage CO2 gas emissions.

Due to high regulatory measures, this topic is becoming one of the most sustainable themes among emerging areas. There is ample literature on ESG as a sustainable business goal (SBG), but only a few studies have identified the factors that encourage the adoption of ESG reporting. The research aims to identify, determine and analyse the enablers of adopting ESG reporting adoption in developing economy India. Design/methodology/approach This study explores the strategic enablers that facilitate adopting ESG reporting practices in India. A thorough literature review and expert interviews were organized to accomplish the study’s goals. Initially identifying 23 enablers through expert interviews, this paper left with nine key enablers. Through an empirical analysis using m-TISM and MICMAC analysis, the current study has formulated the hierarchical structure to determine the relationship between strategic, operational and performance variables. Findings The research findings highlighted that the variables at the bottom of the model – a regulatory framework for a standardized code of reporting (E1), corporate governance reforms (E2) and regulatory efforts (E3) – are strategic determinants designed for successful ESG reporting adoption. Research limitations/implications To capitalize on these facilitators, the government must impose mandatory disclosure and advance the policies, rules and advantages of ESG reporting adoption.

Notably, Financial Engineering students exhibited higher proficiency and more positive perceptions of AI tools compared to students in other disciplines, such as Engineering and Business. An observational study utilizing eye tracker technology and facial expression analysis highlighted the emotional dynamics between AI-enhanced and traditional lecture-based classes. Positive emotions, such as joy and surprise, were significantly more prevalent in AI-enhanced environments, contributing to a more engaging and emotionally positive learning experience. However, an increase in fear was also observed, which could be considered a negative activating emotion that, ultimately, still fostered learning. Semi-structured interviews with educators revealed both the opportunities and challenges of AI integration. Educators acknowledged AI’s benefits in enhancing pedagogy but expressed concerns about over-reliance and ethical implications. Thematic analysis identified key dimensions: knowledge, usage, and ethics in AI. The study concluded that AI tools could significantly transform finance education, offering enhanced learning experiences and better preparing students for future careers. However, a balanced approach, addressing ethical and psychological impacts, was essential to maximize benefits and minimize potential drawbacks. Future research should explore AI’s long-term effects and its correlation with academic performance. PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT This study highlights how Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are shaping finance education by examining their effects on students’ learning experiences, emotional responses, and educators’ perspectives. AI tools, such as ChatGPT and FinChat, were shown to improve students’ engagement and understanding, particularly in finance-related subjects. The study’s findings suggest that students, especially in Financial Engineering, not only gain valuable skills but also experience increased positive emotions, like joy and surprise, during AI-enhanced classes. However, an observed rise in fear also indicated the importance of addressing emotional challenges in AI-driven learning. Educators viewed AI tools as beneficial for enhancing teaching but raised concerns about ethical considerations and over-reliance. This research underscores the transformative potential of AI in finance education while advocating for a thoughtful balance between its advantages and challenges. These insights are relevant for educators, students, and policymakers as they consider the future integration of AI in academic environments.",281816157,4,87,,

Prospect theory assumes that decision-makers react quickly when decisions are framed as a risk or threat rather than as an opportunity.Design/methodology/approachWe used a sample of 168 FIs across 27 countries and seven regions over the period 2003–2020. To conduct our empirical investigation, we compared the prediction accuracy of various machine learning algorithms.FindingsOur findings suggest that out of 12 machine learning algorithms, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost have the most precision in predicting whether FIs react to climate change risk in adopting ESG practices. This study also tested the overall climate change risk and risks associated with physical, opportunity and regulatory shocks of climate change. We observed that risks associated with physical and regulatory shocks significantly impact the adoption of ESG practices, supporting prospect theory predictions.Practical implicationsThe insights of this study provide important implications for policymakers. Specifically, policymakers must take into account the risk posed by climate change in the corporate decision-making process, as it directly influences a firm’s adoption of corporate actions (ESG practices).Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the firm-level climate change risk and adoption of ESG practices from a prospect theory perspective using novel machine learning algorithms.",274110846,4,95,,

The involvement of the financial sector is a fundamental pillar in this task, which has led to the emergence of a new field in the literature, climate finance. In turn, the use of Machine Learning (ML) as a tool to analyze climate finance is on the rise, due to the need to use big data to collect new climate-related information and model complex non-linear relationships. Considering the proliferation of articles in this field, and the potential for the use of ML, we propose a review of the academic literature to assess how ML is enabling climate finance to scale up. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a structure of application domains in a highly fragmented research field, aiming to spur further innovative work from ML experts. To pursue this objective, first we perform a systematic search of three scientific databases to assemble a corpus of relevant studies. Using topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) we uncover representative thematic clusters. This allows us to statistically identify seven granular areas where ML is playing a significant role in climate finance literature: natural hazards, biodiversity, agricultural risk, carbon markets, energy economics, ESG factors &amp; investing, and climate data. Second, we perform an analysis highlighting publication trends; and thirdly, we show a breakdown of ML methods applied by research area.",254373247,3,166,,

The relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and information technology (IT) is crucial in shaping international climate change strategies. This study investigates the impact of information technology, trade globalisation (TG), and economic complexity (EC) on CO2 emissions in BRICS countries using panel data from 1996 to 2018. The analysis applies the CUP-FM estimator to assess long-run relationships and the Dumitrescu–Hurlin panel causality test to evaluate directionality. The results show that information technology significantly reduces CO2 emissions. This effect is primarily driven by the promotion of the service sector, reduced material use, and improved energy efficiency. In contrast, trade globalisation has an inconsistent impact. While it can lower emissions through technology diffusion and efficiency gains, it can also increase them due to Scale Effects and the relocation of polluting industries. This study also identifies a U-shaped relationship between economic complexity and CO2 emissions, indicating that emissions initially rise with complexity but decline as innovation and clean production practices improve. These findings suggest that developing digital infrastructure and green technologies and trade Globalisation can promote sustainable development in BRICS economies. Therefore, policymakers should prioritise strengthening the IT environment, fostering international trade partnerships, and integrating clean technologies to balance economic growth with environmental protection.",287631255,3,125,,

Drawing on panel data from 2011–2012 to 2023–2024 for 86 publicly listed non-financial firms, the study employed a modified Ohlson valuation framework, panel regression analysis, and multiple robustness techniques (2SLS, PSM). ESG disclosure was measured using a researcher-developed index aligned with international reporting standards (GRI, SASB, TCFD, UN SDGs). ESG disclosures are positively associated with firm value, but this relationship is significantly moderated by corporate maturity. Younger firms exhibit a stronger valuation effect from ESG transparency, driven by higher signaling and legitimacy needs. In contrast, mature firms experience a diminished marginal benefit, reflecting routine compliance rather than strategic differentiation. These findings challenge the uniform application of ESG assessment models and suggest the need for lifecycle-adjusted disclosure ratings, particularly in nascent regulatory environments like Bangladesh. Investors and regulators should tailor ESG evaluation criteria by firm age and industry sustainability exposure. Younger firms, often overlooked, may carry outsized ESG signaling value in emerging markets. Enhancing ESG transparency among younger firms can foster greater stakeholder trust, support inclusive growth, and strengthen social accountability in emerging economies. This study contributes to the ESG literature by introducing corporate maturity as a key moderating variable in value relevance analysis. It provides new empirical insights from a developing economy and proposes lifecycle-based adaptations to global ESG rating methodologies.",288445390,3,36,,

Its capacity to establish an unalterable record of transactions ensures that once data is recorded, it remains impervious to modification, thereby furnishing an unparalleled level of security. This inherent security attribute positions Blockchain as an optimal choice for reinforcing financial systems against cyber threats and fraudulent activities. On the other hand, AI contributes predictive analytics, machine learning, and automation to the forefront of financial operations. The integration of AI in finance enables real-time data analysis, risk assessment, and decision-making, optimizing processes and elevating overall efficiency. When amalgamated with Blockchain, AI augments the precision and dependability of financial data, cultivating a more secure and transparent ecosystem. A pivotal aspect of this integration in finance is the streamlining of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. The decentralized nature of Blockchain facilitates secure storage of customer data, mitigating the risk of identity theft, while AI algorithms adeptly analyze extensive datasets to pinpoint and flag suspicious activities. This not only augments security but also ensures adherence to regulatory requirements. Smart contracts, a distinctive feature of Blockchain, automate and enforce contractual agreements, diminishing the reliance on intermediaries and minimizing the probability of human error. AI algorithms can be seamlessly integrated into these contracts to enhance their adaptability and responsiveness to evolving market conditions, further refining financial processes. The transparency ushered in by Blockchain ensures that all stakeholders have access to a singular version of the truth, fostering trust in financial transactions. Furthermore, the incorporation of AI in fraud detection and risk management heightens the proactive identification of potential threats, safeguarding financial institutions and their clientele. As financial institutions increasingly embrace this integration, the industry stands on the brink of a revolution that not only safeguards against existing challenges but also paves the way for innovative and efficient financial ecosystems.",266801050,63,144,,

This research not only seeks to corroborate the AIDUA model in the banking sector, but also aims to enrich it by introducing technological literacy as a moderating factor, particularly in the perspective of sustainable banking. Data were collected through 435 valid, self-administered face-to-face surveys from bank customers in China, determined through convenience sampling. The hypotheses, covering both direct and moderating effects, were examined using structural equation modeling. This study verifies the applicability and reliability of the AIDUA model, in assessing customer acceptance of AIDs within sustainable banking services. The findings indicate that customer acceptance of AIDs unfolds in three distinct phases. Initially, the consumers’ perceptions of social influence (SI), hedonic motivation (HM), and perceived anthropomorphism (PA) positively influence their green performance expectancy (GPE) and green effort expectancy (GEE) concerning AIDs. As a result, greater GPE and GEE among bank customers lead to stronger positive emotions, which greatly contribute to increased AIDs usage and a reduction in resistance to their implementation. Additionally, the findings determine that technological literacy plays a substantial moderating role in the association connecting green performance expectancy and customer emotions in relation to adopting AIDs, thereby highlighting its importance in advancing sustainable banking initiatives.",280094739,14,82,,

This paper explores an Adaptive Risk-sensitive Transformer-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (ART-DRL) framework to improve portfolio optimization in commodity futures trading. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied in equities and forex, its use in commodities remains underexplored. We evaluate DRL models, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), integrating dynamic reward functions and asset-specific optimization. Empirical results show improvements in risk-adjusted performance, with an annualized return of 1.353, a Sharpe Ratio of 4.340, and a Sortino Ratio of 57.766. Although the return is below DQN (1.476), the proposed model achieves better stability and risk control. Notably, the models demonstrate resilience by learning from historical periods of extreme volatility, including the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021) and geopolitical shocks such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict (2022), despite testing commencing in January 2023. This research offers a practical, data-driven framework for risk-sensitive decision-making in commodities, showing how machine learning can support portfolio management under volatile market conditions.",287958457,7,20,,

Yet, conventional literature often neglects to critically examine their economic, environmental, and social implications. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand when, how, and for whom artificial intelligence and big data in sustainable entrepreneurship generate value. Our findings suggest that the three dimensions of sustainability—economic, environmental, and social—should be examined through a tri‐level impact prism: the immediate efficiency or transparency gains firms report; the hidden or temporally deferred costs that accumulate; and—notably—the distributional consequences that determine who reaps the benefits and who inherits the burdens. Direct benefits can evolve into costs over time and, if neglected, may reinforce injustices that rebound and erode future gains. Whether the broader trajectory settles on the virtuous or vicious side of that loop depends on five boundary conditions: organizational capabilities, technological maturity, socio‐cultural values, sectoral and regulatory context, and temporal dynamics. Our study advances theory by extending the triple‐bottom‐line lens into a reflexive impact‐by‐cost framework—one that foregrounds rebound effects and justice considerations, injects power, path dependency, and distributional conflict into socio‐technical transition debates, and recasts contingency and dynamic capabilities theories around shifting cost and justice configurations.",288346791,7,134,,

Based on the export data of 100 developing countries on the product level from 1999 to 2015, this paper empirically explores the relationship between FDI and product export survival of the host country using the survival analysis model. The estimations show that FDI is conducive to the extension of the export duration of domestic products, and this effect is more evident in products with comparative advantages. Mechanism inspections prove that FDIs extend the export duration of products by improving their quality. To overcome endogenous problems, this paper establishes instrumental variables of FDI based on population and geographical factors. The results of the two-stage least square regression support the conclusions derived from the benchmark regression.

This paper takes the first round of Central Environmental Protection Inspection as a natural experiment, reflecting the degree of green transformation through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) level of enterprises. Taking Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2022 as the research object, a dual machine learning model is used to determine whether this system can improve the ESG level of enterprises and promote their green transformation. Using a dual machine learning model, it is found that the system can enhance the ESG level of enterprises and promote their green transformation. Mechanism analyses show that the system promotes green transformation by enhancing green innovation capability, safeguarding the rights and interests of upstream and downstream supply chain actors, and enhancing governance diligence, thus encouraging enterprises to assume environmental, social, and governance responsibilities. It is also found that at the macro-policy level, with the migration of the inspection area to the west and the strengthening of local environmental governance, and at the micro-firm level, the higher the degree of digitization and the larger the size of assets, the deeper the system effect on the green transformation of heavy-polluting enterprises.

Lessmann",arXiv.org,2023,"Traditional banks face increasing competition from FinTechs in the rapidly evolving financial ecosystem. Raising operational efficiency is vital to address this challenge. Our study aims to improve the efficiency of document-intensive business processes in banking. To that end, we first review the landscape of business documents in the retail segment. Banking documents often contain text, layout, and visuals, suggesting that document analytics and process automation require more than plain natural language processing (NLP). To verify this and assess the incremental value of visual cues when processing business documents, we compare a recently proposed multimodal model called LayoutXLM to powerful text classifiers (e.g., BERT) and large language models (e.g., GPT) in a case study related to processing company register extracts. The results confirm that incorporating layout information in a model substantially increases its performance. Interestingly, we also observed that more than 75% of the best model performance (in terms of the F1 score) can be achieved with as little as 30% of the training data. This shows that the demand for data labeled data to set up a multi-modal model can be moderate, which simplifies real-world applications of multimodal document analytics. Our study also sheds light on more specific practices in the scope of calibrating a multimodal banking document classifier, including the need for fine-tuning. In sum, the paper contributes original empirical evidence on the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-model models for document processing in the banking business and offers practical guidance on how to unlock this potential in day-to-day operations.",267011995,7,68,,

A survey of 485 consumers served as the empirical foundation, with data analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM). Results show that minimalism and LOHAS both significantly enhance consumers' sustainable behaviors by strengthening attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control—key components of TPB. Furthermore, collectivist cultural values heighten the impact of minimalism and LOHAS on certain TPB constructs, indicating that communal support and shared environmental goals can amplify pro‐sustainability mindsets and actions. These findings underscore the importance of lifestyle‐driven approaches to sustainability, suggesting that firms and policymakers tailor marketing and policy initiatives to cultural contexts and highlight both the health and ecological benefits of minimalist, LOHAS‐aligned choices.

The Taiwan dataset from 2013 to 2020 indicates that ESG practices positively affect accounting‐ and market‐based performance (i.e., adjusted Tobin's Q and adjusted MTB ratio). However, ESG has no significant relationship with purely market‐based performance (i.e., adjusted Jensen Alpha and adjusted FF3). The results illustrate a significant joint effect of ESG with foreigners on board and export experience on accounting and market‐based performance. The findings provide deeper insight into the complex relationship between sustainability practices, ownership structures, and international businesses.

This conceptual article addresses the theoretical and strategic gap in aligning resilience and sustainability by proposing an Integrated Sustainable Operational Strategy (ISOS) framework. Drawing on systems theory, circular economy principles, and sustainability science, the framework synthesizes multiple operational domains—circularity, localization, digital adaptation, and workforce flexibility—across macro (policy), meso (organizational), and micro (process) levels. This study constructs a conceptual model that explains the interdependencies and trade-offs among strategic operational responses in the Anthropocene era. Supported by multi-level logic and a synthesis of domain constructs, the model provides a foundation for empirical investigation and strategic planning. Key propositions for future research are developed, focusing on causal relationships and boundary conditions. The novelty of ISOS lies in its simultaneous integration of three strategic pillars—circularity, localization, and digital resilience—within a unified, multi-scalar architecture that bridges fragmented operational theories. The article advances theory by redefining operational excellence through regenerative logic and adaptive capacity, responding directly to SDG 9 (industry innovation), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (climate action). This integrative framework offers both theoretical insight and practical guidance for transforming operations into catalysts of sustainable transition.",289595465,3,181,,

A literature review shows that no detailed studies have examined whether, or how, sustainable human resource management (SHRM) practices can contribute to the development of effective international trade governance models. The role of human resource management (HRM) in major international trade agreements proposed by the World Trade Organization, USA, and EU is analyzed and discussed. Adopting a narrative review method, this study formulates and discusses six propositions on the potential contribution of SHRM practices to enhancing the effectiveness of international trade governance. A model to carry out a construct and criterion validation of such SHRM practices to increase the efficacy of international trade governance is proposed. Finally, critical issues arising from the constraints imposed by the current international context—marked by high levels of uncertainty and conflict—are analyzed.

Concerns are growing over the opacity of such complex AI models, particularly deep learning architectures. To address this concern, explainability is of paramount importance, which has triggered the emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) as a vital research area. XAI is aimed at enhancing transparency, trust, and accountability of AI models. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of XAI from the dual perspectives of challenges and opportunities. We analyze the foundational concepts, definitions, terminologies, and taxonomy of XAI methods. We then review several application domains of XAI. Special attention is given to various challenges of XAI, such as no universal definition, trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, and lack of standardized evaluation metrics.

The results reveal that firms with superior ESG ratings tend to exhibit stronger SBMI capabilities. Furthermore, patient capital and corporate reputation serve as partial mediators in this relationship, indicating that ESG indirectly promotes SBMI by attracting long-term-oriented capital and enhancing a firm’s reputation. Based on these observations, it is advised that the participation of green investors, the advancement of digital transformation, and the implementation of government innovation subsidies all significantly strengthen the positive impact of ESG on SBMI. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that (1) governments enhance innovation subsidy policies, (2) enterprises deepen the integration of ESG practices with digital transformation and actively attract green investors, and (3) green investors use financial tools to support the development of SBMI.

Based on 273 cases and using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), this paper tests eight direct and moderating hypotheses. The results reveal that both gender diversity and board size positively impact firm value, while board size successfully reduces firm risk. However, gender diversity does not mitigate risks. The findings indicate that increasing board gender diversity and size are positively related to performance, while only board size contributes effectively to risk reduction. ESG disclosures play a moderating role, enhancing the synergy between gender diversity and performance but showing mixed effects on risk reduction. Overall, the study highlights the importance of integrating gender diversity and strong ESG practices to achieve better performance outcomes, improve transparency, and develop a more competitive corporate strategy.

10.1109/tifs.2025.3612149,LMAE4Eth: Generalizable and Robust Ethereum Fraud Detection by Exploring Transaction Semantics and Masked Graph Embedding,"Yifan Jia, Yanbin Wang, Jianguo Sun, Ye Tian, Peng Qian",IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2025,"As Ethereum confronts increasingly sophisticated fraud threats, recent research seeks to improve fraud account detection by leveraging advanced pre-trained Transformer or self-supervised graph neural network. However, current Transformer-based methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations, and leverages language modeling to learn transaction semantics. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective, which, together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features rather than graph structure. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Additionally, we initialize the account nodes in the graph with expert-engineered features to inject empirical and statistical knowledge into the model. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves the F1-score by over 10% at most compared with the best baseline. Furthermore, we observe from three datasets that the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization ability compared to previous work.

It is an assessment of the bank’s financial health, stability and capacity to manage risks. This paper aims to investigate the credit rating patterns that are crucial for assessing creditworthiness of the Islamic banks, thereby evaluating the stability of their industry. Design/methodology/approach Three distinct machine learning algorithms are exploited and evaluated for the desired objective. This research initially uses the decision tree machine learning algorithm as a base learner conducting an in-depth comparison with the ensemble decision tree and Random Forest. Subsequently, the Apriori algorithm is deployed to uncover the most significant attributes impacting a bank’s credit rating. To appraise the previously elucidated models, a ten-fold cross-validation method is applied. This method involves segmenting the data sets into ten folds, with nine used for training and one for testing alternatively ten times changeable. This approach aims to mitigate any potential biases that could arise during the learning and training phases. Following this process, the accuracy is assessed and depicted in a confusion matrix as outlined in the methodology section. Findings The findings of this investigation reveal that the Random Forest machine learning algorithm superperforms others, achieving an impressive 90.5% accuracy in predicting credit ratings. Notably, our research sheds light on the significance of the loan-to-deposit ratio as a primary attribute affecting credit rating predictions. Moreover, this study uncovers additional pivotal banking features that intensely impact the measurements under study. This paper’s findings provide evidence that the loan-to-deposit ratio looks to be the purest bank attribute that affects credit rating prediction. In addition, deposit-to-assets ratio and profit sharing investment account ratio criteria are found to be effective in credit rating prediction and the ownership structure criterion came to be viewed as one of the essential bank attributes in credit rating prediction. Originality/value These findings contribute significant evidence to the understanding of attributes that strongly influence credit rating predictions within the banking sector.

The sample comprises 418 agricultural companies, grouped according to the availability and verification of their disclosures. The findings reveal that only 30% of these companies implement independent verification processes, while the majority disclose information without ensuring its accuracy. Companies that conduct verification produce more detailed reports that are aligned with international standards such as GRI and ISAE 3000. In contrast, companies without verification tend to use more general and less quantitative language, making it difficult to assess their actual impact.

In Indonesia, the establishment of the IDX ESG Leaders index provides a relevant platform to evaluate how such disclosure, alongside financial fundamentals, contributes to firm value. Despite expectations that non-financial transparency enhances valuation, empirical findings in emerging markets remain inconsistent, warranting further investigation.ObjectivesThis study examines the effects of environmental, social, and governance disclosure and capital structure on firm value among firms listed in the IDX ESG Leaders index from 2020 to 2023. It also explores whether profitability moderates these relationships by strengthening or weakening their impact on valuation.MethodThe research adopts a quantitative approach using panel data regression with 68 firm-year observations from 17 IDX ESG Leaders firms. ESG disclosure indices were constructed through content analysis of annual and sustainability reports, while financial data were obtained from audited statements. Profitability, proxied by return on assets, was incorporated as a moderating variable through moderated regression analysis to identify conditional effects.ResultsThe findings reveal that environmental and social disclosure do not directly influence firm value, while governance disclosure exerts a significant negative effect. Capital structure shows a strong positive impact, and profitability both directly enhances firm value and moderates certain relationships. Specifically, profitability weakens the effect of social disclosure but strengthens the influence of capital structure, suggesting that investors prioritize financial fundamentals over non-financial reporting.ImplicationsThe results highlight the conditional relevance of ESG disclosure in emerging markets and reinforce the continuing importance of profitability and capital structure. Theoretically, the study challenges the universality of stakeholder and signaling theories by revealing context-dependent effects. Practically, it provides guidance for managers to align disclosure with financial strength and for policymakers to strengthen ESG reporting standards.Originality/NoveltyThis study contributes to the literature by disaggregating ESG disclosure into environmental, social, and governance dimensions and incorporating profitability as a moderating variable.

It synthesizes the technology stack (UI modules, data management, gateways, messaging, and security), regulatory context, user experience determinants, and market dynamics, and complements these with case-style insights and a brief EU comparison. Findings indicate that, although online and mobile banking penetration in Greece has lagged behind EU averages, mobile access is now the primary driver of uptake. The integration imperative—shared services/APIs over reliable back-ends—emerges as the central technical enabler, while perceived security (confidentiality, strong authentication, non-repudiation) remains the dominant adoption barrier. User experience quality and multichannel consistency strongly influence usage frequency and trust, and legacy infrastructure plus skills gaps constrain delivery speed. The trajectory points to the convergence of mobile and web banking, with branches shifting toward advisory roles. Practical recommendations include a mobile-led product roadmap, investment in resilience and observability of back-end services, rigorous multi-factor authentication (MFA)/device binding and risk controls, a unified design system across channels, and analytics-driven customer relationship management (CRM) for personalization. Overall, the paper offers an end-to-end view connecting technology, regulation, and strategy to guide executives and practitioners in scaling secure, user-centric mobile banking within Greece’s banking ecosystem.",290890861,1,26,,

However, the literature at the intersection of data‐driven and sustainable BMI remains conceptually dispersed, limiting theoretical progress and practical application. To consolidate the literature, we combine a systematic literature review with bibliometric coupling to conceptualize data‐driven sustainable BMI. First, we identify five distinct research streams—digital platforms, circular economy, smart manufacturing and supply chains, blockchain, and servitization—which reflect diverse technological pathways to transform traditional business models into sustainable ones. Second, we develop a dynamic capabilities‐based process model that explains how companies can achieve this transformation by orchestrating data‐driven and sustainable capabilities across the initiation, ideation, integration, and implementation phases of BMI. This study advances theoretical understanding and provides practical guidance on how data‐driven technologies can enable positive environmental, social, and economic outcomes.",290940641,1,236,,

Earnings transparency (ET) is fundamental to financial integrity and corporate governance. However, existing literature lacks a unified framework to synthesise key insights and emerging trends. This study aims to meticulously analyse existing work on ET to provide a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis of the academic advancement in this field.

Design/methodology/approach
A systematic review of 35 peer-reviewed studies was performed following the preferred-reporting-items-for-systematic-reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol, using sources, including Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The hybrid methodology was used, combining bibliometric techniques to identify intellectual structures, research trends and thematic clusters with the antecedents-decision-outcomes (ADO) Framework to categorise antecedents, decisions and outcomes.

Findings
The study highlights that ET mitigates information asymmetry, enhances financial disclosure quality and boosts investors’ confidence. However, regulatory inconsistencies and market-specific variations create challenges in standardising ET practices. Emerging trends, including AI-driven auditing, blockchain technology and environmental, social and governance (ESG)-aligned disclosures, are reshaping the transparency framework, necessitating adaptive governance mechanisms.

Practical implications
The review provides a structured roadmap for policymakers, and underscores the need for global disclosure harmonisation. Corporate lenders can leverage transparent earnings reporting to enhance investor relations and mitigate financial risk. Investors benefit from improved decision-making and lower exposure to earnings manipulation.

Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to systematically consolidate ET research using bibliometric techniques and the ADO framework, bridging disciplinary gaps and outlining critical future research avenues.

Grounded in social exchange theory and extending stakeholder exchange orchestration mechanisms, the research proposes that ESG initiatives foster reciprocal stakeholder relationships that drive innovation and performance through specific temporal and cultural exchange processes. Using survey data from 453 Chinese green manufacturing enterprises, we applied structural equation modeling to test the theoretical framework. Findings show that all perceived ESG dimensions, environmental, social, and governance significantly enhance both green technology innovation and competitive performance. Green technology innovation serves as a key mediator, illustrating how sustainability initiatives create competitive advantages through innovation mechanisms. Digital transformation amplifies these effects across all perceived ESG dimensions. This research contributes to sustainability literature by introducing stakeholder exchange orchestration theory, validating perception-based ESG measurements in emerging market contexts, and demonstrating digitally enhanced social exchange mechanisms.

Using data on Chinese A‐share listed companies from 2009 to 2020, we explore the relationship between geographic concentration of institutional investors and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Our findings indicate that investors' geographic concentration has an inverted U‐shaped influence on ESG performance, and high‐speed railway and institutional environment weaken the negative influence of geographic concentration of institutional shareholders, leading to a flatter inverted U‐shaped relationship. As high‐speed railway and institutional environment further flatten the curve, the inverted U‐shaped relationship will eventually become U‐shaped, and a “shape‐flip” occurs.

As an important part of the ecological system, rural areas also face many challenges. Rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality, as a solution, have attracted widespread attention. However, achieving the coordinated development of rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality requires more in-depth research and effective methods.This study aims to explore how to promote the coordinated development of rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality through the combination of a Transformer-RNN model and cross-attention mechanism. We propose a deep learning framework that combines the parallelism and global dependency capturing capabilities of the Transformer model with the temporal information handling capabilities of the RNN model. By integrating these two models, we leverage their respective strengths to improve the performance of the model. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism that enables the model to simultaneously focus on the relationship between rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality. Through cross-attention, the model accurately captures the impact of rural ecological construction measures on carbon neutrality and the feedback effect of carbon neutrality on the rural ecological environment. In our experiments, we collected relevant data on rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality, including environmental indicators, socio-economic factors, land use patterns, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.We preprocess the data and train the combined Transformer-RNN model with the cross-attention mechanism. The trained model demonstrates promising results in capturing the complex dependencies and relationships between rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality. The significance of this study lies in deepening the understanding of the coordinated development relationship between rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality and providing a novel deep learning-based method to solve related problems. By introducing the Transformer-RNN model with a cross-attention mechanism, we provide decision-makers with more scientific and accurate decision support, promoting the improvement of the rural ecological environment and the achievement of carbon neutrality goals.",268810063,1,41,,

For instance, the European Union (EU) recently issued the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in December 2022 and implemented it starting in 2024 in member states. Non-financial disclosure is relevant for various stakeholders and could affect firm value. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of ESG disclosure on firm value in the EU context. Design/methodology/approach This study uses panel data on listed EU firms extracted from the Bloomberg database from 2014 to 2024. The final sample comprises 11,003 firm-year observations. The ordinary least squares method is used as a baseline regression. This study addresses the endogeneity issues by applying instrumental variable and two-step system dynamic panel generalised method of moments approaches. Findings The results of the univariate tests, including the mean-difference comparison test based on pre-CSRD and CSRD issuance periods, reveal a significant decrease in the average ESG disclosure score in the CSRD issuance period. These results are similar for individual ESG pillars. Further, the results show a significant reduction in average firm value in the CSRD issuance period. The regression results report a significant and positive effect of ESG disclosure on firm value. Practical implications This study provides practical implications for policymakers, firms and stakeholders. Based on the findings and the contexts of signalling and institutional theories, regulatory requirements for non-financial reporting on environmental and social issues affect a firm’s sustainable behaviour. This directly impacts various stakeholders, including market participants, and eventually affects market value.

Using a quasi-natural experiment of the staggered construction of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) demonstration cities in China, this paper explores the impact of fiscal policy on green credit (GC) for listed enterprises. The main findings are the following: (1) The ECER demonstration cities policy significantly improves enterprise GC. This conclusion remains robust after considering the heterogeneous treatment effects. (2) By extending the estimation period beyond the policy withdrawal, we use the difference-in-differences designs with multiple groups and periods (DIDM) estimator to compute the average treatment effect of policy switches. The results show that the intervention effect still exists after the policy withdrawal. (3) Direct cash subsidies, corporate green spending, and external financing constraints are the main mechanisms through which the ECER demonstration cities policy works. (4) The effects of the ECER demonstration cities policy are heterogeneous at the batch, urban, industry, and corporate levels. This paper explores the role of fiscal policy on enterprise green financing. The findings provide theoretical and empirical insights for leveraging fiscal tools to enhance environmental governance.

Drawing upon the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT), this research integrates perceived AI literacy into the AI acceptance–avoidance framework as a central variable. This study gathered 583 valid survey responses from China and validated its model using a dual-phase, combined method that integrates structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks. Research findings indicate that the model explains 51.6% of the variance in generative AI usage intention. Except for social influence, all variables within the extended framework significantly impact the usage intention, with perceived AI literacy being the strongest predictor (β = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, perceived AI literacy mitigates the adverse effect of perceived threats on the intention to use AI. Practical implications suggest that enterprises adopt a tiered strategy, as follows: maximize perceived benefits by integrating AI skills into reward systems and providing task-automation training; minimize perceived costs through dedicated technical support and transparent risk mitigation plans; and cultivate AI literacy via progressive learning paths, advancing from data analysis to innovation.",289627644,5,93,,

Barford, Annabel Beales, Marina Zorila",Business Strategy &amp; Development,2025,"Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere is Goal 1 of the Sustainable Development Goals the widespread payment of living wages as a minimum could substantially boost progress towards this development goal and others. Living wages, typically set higher than minimum wages, pay enough for workers to meet their needs and those of their families. Without living wages many workers earn poverty wages. Recognising renewed corporate and investor interest in living wages, this paper interrogates the logics and rationalities which shape discussions on living wages, drawing upon 31 semi‐structured interviews with living wage professionals. Discourse analysis is used to identify the logics and rationalities which shape organisation‐level progress towards living wages. Some logics, surrounding human rights, stakeholder capitalism, sustainable development, redistribution and social justice, encourage the implementation of living wages. Other logics, including shareholder capitalism, profit and mass consumerism, create a chilling effect on the living wages movement. At present, wages are the main mechanism for distributing money, so wage levels impact people's access to services and resources. The living wages agenda is progressing rapidly, comprising a 2024 International Labour Organization meeting of experts, corporate and investor commitments, worker demands, and the growing prevalence of geographically specific living wages calculations. It is therefore crucial that the logics and narratives underpinning decisions on pay are interrogated as these play a pivotal role in progress towards human rights, social justice and the Sustainable Development Goals.",284017984,5,60,,

However, ESG data remain fragmented, inconsistent, and prone to methodological opacity—particularly in climate-related investments. This systematic review analyzes 43 peer-reviewed articles and 23 institutional reports to examine whether machine-learning-based ESG scoring models outperform rule-based systems in predicting sustainable investment performance. Following the PRISMA protocol, we applied thematic coding, regional benchmarking, and methodological evaluation across AI–ESG applications. A comparative framework was used to assess AI’s role in ESG integration, predictive analytics, impact measurement, and risk management, with a focus on the climate domain. We also propose and refine the ESG–AI Maturity Index, evaluating AI adoption capacity across data quality, model transparency, and portfolio integration. Findings reveal that AI-enhanced models—particularly those using ensemble learning and sentiment analysis—demonstrate superior performance in forecasting ESG outcomes. However, challenges such as algorithmic bias, regional data gaps, and lack of interpretability remain persistent. The ESG–AI Maturity Index provides a preliminary diagnostic tool for evaluating institutional readiness to adopt AI in ESG scoring. This review contributes by clarifying the performance advantages and limitations of AI-based ESG systems, proposing a framework for maturity assessment, and highlighting urgent policy and technical needs to advance ethical, scalable AI adoption in sustainable finance.",289894833,5,49,,

Using 10 years of panel data across resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service sectors, the analysis employs the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for robust estimation. The results reveal a positive overall effect of ESG practices on ROA, with significant differences across industries. The study uses the categorization of resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service industries to examine the differential effects of ESG factors on ROA. However, environmental scores do not significantly impact ROA, suggesting uniform effects across industries. Social scores enhance ROA without notable industry‐specific differences, while governance scores show varying effects, indicating sector‐specific drivers of profitability. The analysis also highlights the moderating effects of industry categories on the ESG–ROA relationship, suggesting that the impact of ESG practices varies across different sectors. The study also considers the economic effects of COVID‐19, highlighting its marginal impact on ROA and the need for resilient financial strategies. However, the moderating effect of COVID‐19 on this relationship was not significant, indicating limited variation in the ESG–ROA dynamics during the pandemic period except in the governance model. These findings suggest that tailored ESG strategies, aligned with industry‐specific challenges, can optimize financial performance. Policymakers and investors are encouraged to focus on sector‐specific ESG practices to better evaluate company performance and formulate effective regulations. This research contributes to the emerging market context by emphasizing the importance of industry‐specific ESG integration for enhancing financial outcomes.",283794597,5,96,,

Prospect theory assumes that decision-makers react quickly when decisions are framed as a risk or threat rather than as an opportunity.Design/methodology/approachWe used a sample of 168 FIs across 27 countries and seven regions over the period 2003–2020. To conduct our empirical investigation, we compared the prediction accuracy of various machine learning algorithms.FindingsOur findings suggest that out of 12 machine learning algorithms, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost have the most precision in predicting whether FIs react to climate change risk in adopting ESG practices. This study also tested the overall climate change risk and risks associated with physical, opportunity and regulatory shocks of climate change. We observed that risks associated with physical and regulatory shocks significantly impact the adoption of ESG practices, supporting prospect theory predictions.Practical implicationsThe insights of this study provide important implications for policymakers. Specifically, policymakers must take into account the risk posed by climate change in the corporate decision-making process, as it directly influences a firm’s adoption of corporate actions (ESG practices).Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the firm-level climate change risk and adoption of ESG practices from a prospect theory perspective using novel machine learning algorithms.",274791154,4,77,,

These subcategories include resource use, emission reduction and innovation under the environmental pillar, workforce, human rights, community and product responsibility under the social pillar and management, shareholders and CSR strategy under the governance pillar. Design/methodology/approach A machine learning technique known as “topic modeling” is used to analyse the current literature on ESG. To investigate the correlation between ESG scores and their subcategories with the investment decisions made by FII and to address concerns regarding multicollinearity and overfitting, a penalty-based regression model is employed. Findings The findings indicate that FIIs invest in firms with higher emission reduction and innovation scores under the environmental indicator. Additionally, firms with high human rights, community and product responsibility scores under the social indicator category have a positive relationship with FII investors. All subcategories of governance indicators, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), strategy, shareholders and management scores, also positively impact FII investment. Of the three indicators, i.e. ESG, non-promoter FIIs give maximum weightage to governance indicators. Research limitations/implications Since ESG is a contemporary topic, the findings on the relationship between different categories of ESG on FII investment will support managers in their FII investment. Also, the study will help the government frame policy decisions on ESG. Originality/value Previous studies have explored the impact of the overall ESG indicators on FII investments, but they have not specifically studied the influence of sub-indicators within these categories on investment decisions. By addressing this gap, the study enhances stakeholder theory by identifying and prioritizing the various subcategories of ESG indicators that impact FII investment decisions.",274933489,4,60,,

AI-driven systems can process massive amounts of financial data in real time using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms and big data analytics to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate risks or fraud. Predictive models can analyze spending behavior, transaction history, and social data, improving credit risk assessments. Thus, financial institutions can make better lending decisions, lowering default rates and stabilizing portfolios. AI is also good at detecting unusual patterns that may indicate fraud. AI algorithms can continuously monitor transactions and flag those that deviate from norms or match fraud patterns. Banking and payments fraud losses have decreased due to this scrutiny, ensuring consumer and financial institution security. AI's adaptability lets it respond quickly to new fraud schemes, making it a valuable asset in a changing threat landscape. However, using AI for financial risk assessment and fraud detection raises ethical concerns. Model training with large datasets can lead to data privacy breaches and biases, especially if training data are unrepresentative or skewed.

Tian, Yongqiang Zhu, Oleksii Lyulyov, Tetyana Pimonenko",Business Strategy and the Environment,2025,"ABSTRACT In the context of escalating environmental challenges and the imperative for sustainable economic transformation, corporate governance has emerged as a pivotal determinant of green technological innovation (GTI). This study empirically examines the nexus between the governance structure (GS) and GTI within China's manufacturing sector, leveraging an extensive dataset spanning 2011–2021. Through fixed‐effects estimation and intermediary effect modelling, the analysis reveals that a well‐structured GS significantly enhances firms' capacity for technological advancement in sustainability‐oriented innovation. Specifically, the regression results indicate that a one‐unit increase in corporate governance quality (CorpGov) is associated with a 0.249 increase in GTI (Lnpatent) at the 1% confidence level, affirming the substantial role of governance reforms in driving sustainable innovation. A key contribution of this study lies in unveiling the mediating role of internal control, which channels the governance–innovation link by fostering strategic discipline, mitigating risk aversion, and optimizing resource allocation. The results show that internal control quality (CI) increases by 12.183 for each unit improvement in CorpGov ( p &lt; 0.01), and subsequently, CI positively affects GTI, reinforcing its critical function in the innovation mechanism. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that governance reforms exert a disproportionately stronger influence on private enterprises (β = 0.312, p &lt; 0.01) than on state‐owned enterprises (insignificant effect) and firms in China's western regions (β = 0.411, p &lt; 0.01) compared with those in the eastern (β = 0.229) and central (β = 0.274) regions. These findings underscore the role of institutional and regional disparities in shaping the effectiveness of governance‐driven innovation. By integrating governance mechanisms, internal control efficacy and innovation strategy into a unified empirical framework, this research advances the theoretical discourse on corporate sustainability governance. The findings underscore the necessity for governance‐driven policy interventions aimed at fostering innovation‐led environmental sustainability, particularly in economies navigating the transition from regulatory compliance to market‐driven green investment.",291233850,1,81,,

Using Sign bias test and GARCH family models, the study finds that ESG equity indices have a leverage effect, significantly impacted by bad news over good news shock. The study has used FIGARCH model to measure the persistence of long‐memory effects across the emerging market. Further, to ensure the interconnection between ESG equity indices that may arise due to the persistence of long‐memory effects, the stusy has examined estimates of TVP‐VAR, and finds moderate interconnection between ESG equity indices. To be specific, ESG equity indices of the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea, Singapore, and India are more sensitive to receiving any sustainable innovation shocks from Brazil, South Africa, and Mexican ESG indices. The study finds significant bidirectional relationships between the ESG equity indices of “Philippines and Brazil,” “Indonesia and India,” and “South Africa and Mexico” that may lead to the spreading of market contagion in the presence of more substantial leverage effects with a long memory. This research offers insights for investors to consider sustainable equity assets for efficient portfolio diversification, mitigating environmental, social, and governance risks associated with volatility spillovers and dynamic connectedness. Policymakers may refer the findings of the study to design effective ESG regulations, for reducing risk in global financial system. Since the pandemic has produced more economic and financial instability in emerging markets, investors and regulators may pay more attention to return and volatility connectivity among ESG equity indices and financial markets to safeguard investment and restore market stability.",283280841,2,61,,

Although there may be an increase in social awareness of these problems, a separate question is whether this increase is reflected in specific legislation in a society.
 The objective of this paper is to quantify for the first time when, where and at what rate these social concerns have been translated into legislation. The study covers the period 1996-2022, identifying both central government legislation and legislation in each of the autonomous regions. The analysis, therefore, organises the information in a panel format. The indicators reveal the high degree of heterogeneity in terms of the legislation in the various related areas, with non-discrimination legislation being the most developed and frequent. They also reveal the differences between autonomous regions, with Andalusia and Catalonia being those in which most legislation has been introduced.

Mohamed Amer, Asil Azimli, Muri Wole Adedokun",Sustainability,2025,"Many companies engage in earnings manipulation that obscures their actual financial condition and sustainability efforts, undermining the credibility of financial reports and eroding stakeholder trust. To address these concerns, the United Kingdom has strictly adhered to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), enhancing financial transparency and reducing the risk of manipulation. This study applies agency theory to examine the effects of earnings management and IFRS adoption on corporate sustainability performance, while also assessing the moderating roles of institutional ownership and board independence. Data were drawn from 248 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange between 2002 and 2024, using purposive sampling and sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon DataStream. Advanced estimation techniques, specifically the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and fixed effects models with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, were employed to address cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity. The results indicate that earnings management, as measured by discretionary accruals, has a significant negative impact on sustainability performance. In contrast, the adoption of IFRS has a positive and significant influence on sustainability outcomes. Additionally, institutional ownership and board independence significantly moderate the adverse effects of earnings management, leading to improved sustainability performance.

Financial market stability forms the foundation of any country’s economic development and prosperity, as it ensures efficient capital movement, reduces uncertainty, and promotes investment growth. However, this stability is vulnerable to various external and internal threats, particularly cyber risks, which can significantly disrupt financial institutions’ operations and even cause serious economic turmoil. The author emphasizes the critical importance of this issue in the era of digital economic transformation, where financial systems become increasingly vulnerable to potentially catastrophic consequences of cyberattacks. The article analyzes the main channels through which cyber incidents impact financial stability, including payment system disruptions, loss of investor and consumer confidence, and critical service failures due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions. Special attention is paid to cyber readiness challenges in developing countries, which often lack sufficient resources and experience to effectively counter digital threats. The author emphasizes the necessity of developing and implementing comprehensive national cybersecurity strategies that would define clear objectives, priorities, and mechanisms for protecting financial infrastructure. These strategies should be based on global best practices and encompass a wide range of measures: from establishing an effective regulatory framework to investing in human capital development. The article also emphasizes the importance of enhancing international cooperation to strengthen cyber resilience, considering the cross-border nature of digital threats. In this context, the key role of global institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, in providing technical assistance to countries, conducting training, and developing universal cyber risk assessment tools is noted. Overall, the article contributes to the study of financial sector cybersecurity issues and offers the author’s vision for addressing them at both national and international levels.",287655662,2,16,,

Using data from the 2021 National Financial Capability Study, multinomial regression analysis was used to explore whether people who rely on social media for investment decisions were more likely to invest in ways that reflect their values. The results show that investors who use social media for investment information are more likely to value being socially responsible as an important reason for investing. Younger, less experienced, and more risk-tolerant investors were especially likely to follow SRI strategies, and certain platforms like Twitter were more associated with SRI interest than others. These findings suggest that social media is not just a platform for sharing information; it may also shape how people think about investing and the role their money can play in making a societal difference. As online platforms continue to influence financial behavior, understanding their impact on values-based investing becomes increasingly important. This research contributes novel insights to the emerging intersection of social media, behavioral finance, and values-driven investing.",288922016,1,39,,

This study examines the relationship between Gen Z prospective employees' moral identity and the ESG practices of companies in influencing perceptions of job attractiveness. A between‐subjects experimental design was employed, developing three conditions (i.e., environmental, social, and governance practices) that focused on sustainable practices in retail companies. To test the main and interaction effects of ESG practices on perceived job attractiveness, a two‐way MANOVA was conducted. The study found that individuals with high levels of both internalized and symbolized moral identity are particularly drawn to companies that demonstrate strong ESG performance, as perceived by job attractiveness. By applying signaling theory to the context of moral identity and ESG practices, this study extends its theoretical scope and offers novel insights into Gen Z's job selection criteria. The findings underscore the necessity for companies to develop tailored ESG strategies that appeal to a diverse range of Gen Z prospective employees, ensuring alignment with their ethical values and career expectations.",290130219,2,49,,

Apart from traditional financial benchmarks including market-to-book ratio, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE), input variables comprise ESG ratings. By means of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, training the SVM model helps to capture the non-linear relationships between business value and ESG performance. Cross-valuation guarantees model robustness; hyperparameter adjustment maximizes the correctness of the model. Business value and ESG scores demonstrate a statistically significant positive link. Forecasting company value, the SVM model gets an accuracy of 87.5%, a precision of 85.2%, a recall of 88.4%, and an F1 score of 86.8%.

Using panel data and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique, we examine the relationship between ESG scores and important financial risk indicators such as systematic risk (beta), stock price volatility, unsystematic risk, and the cost of capital (WACC). The findings show that corporations place a disproportionate emphasis on governance (G) rather than environmental (E) and social (S) characteristics. ESG and G governance were also found to be statistically significant predictors of financial risk. This disparity shows that companies may be using high governance scores to conceal underperformance in environmental and social issues, raising worries about greenwashing and superficial compliance.

The purpose of this article is to explore the application of MBTI in the career field, especially the role and impact in recruitment and talent selection. First, the article introduces the basic theory of MBTI, including the four dimensions (extroversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/emotion, and judging/perception) and the characteristics of 16 personality types, and analyzes how different personality types show unique behaviors and thinking styles at work. The paper then reveals the matching relationship between personality types and occupational requirements by analyzing the needs of different occupational fields. For example, extroverted personalities tend to excel in positions that require high levels of sociability, such as customer service and sales, while introverted personalities are suited to positions that require deep thinking and independent work. 
然后，本文讨论了 MBTI 在人力资源管理中的具体应用，包括如何利用 MBTI 测试进行招聘、人才发展、团队建设等方面的决策。本文通过结合案例研究，展示了 MBTI 在人力资源管理中实际应用的有效性，并讨论了它在选拔过程中可以提供的优势，例如提高选型的科学性和准确性，帮助企业在工作匹配和员工发展方面做出更合理的决策。不过，文章也指出了 MBTI 在其应用中的局限性，包括过度依赖、测试的主观性和缺乏动力等问题。

The work seeks to analyze the development directions and results of artificial intelligence technologies; to assess the capabilities (beneficial effects) of these technologies in economic security systems of organizations; to identify specific threats to economic security, associated with the use of artificial intelligence technologies in organizations; to develop recommendations for mitigating these threats. Methods . The study employed comparative and retrospective analysis, economic-statistical and index methods, as well as special methods for studying economic security, expert-analytical and system approaches. Results . It has been established that the use of artificial intelligence in economic security systems can produce a significant beneficial effect. The advantages of its use in the field under consideration are associated with the fact that in formal analysis (from the standpoint of its rate, accuracy, consistency and taking into account the maximum possible number of factors), the artificial intelligence products surpass human capabilities.

However, there are major assertions that these policies will likely bring about unintended consequences, as some organizations may disclose deceptive information (greenwashing) while others might even ignore material ESG issues to comply with the policies. These issues raise concerns regarding organizational commitments to conducting proper materiality assessments. Subsequently, such concerns represent an emerging research stream in ESG policy development and literature. This article seeks to further the discussions by scientifically mapping the body of knowledge on ESG materiality assessment. Specifically, the review integrates co‐citation, keyword co‐occurrence, and thematic analyses to describe the past and present state of ESG materiality literature. Consequently, four major clusters of articles that researchers and policymakers rely on for ESG materiality philosophical background were identified, i.e., (1) The need for materiality assessment in corporate sustainability, (2) Materiality assessment disclosures for stakeholders, (3) Stakeholder activism for corporate legitimacy, and (4) Integrated reporting frameworks and institutional mechanisms. In contrast, the analysis uncovers five major clusters explaining the present state of ESG materiality assessment. The study further presents insightful research gaps with future research and policy implications. Therefore, the review contributes to contextualizing ESG materiality assessment by stressing the need to deeply understand the underlying constructs explaining the double materiality principle in the mandatory ESG disclosure policy.",289269981,1,107,,

The microenvironment of agricultural enterprises is influenced by the external environment, which affects entrepreneurial activity in different ways. However, any response of managers to external changes must be justified, logical and in line with the needs of the current market. Timely diagnostics of profitability and costs indicators of agricultural enterprises and forecasting of their values are of great importance. Such actions will provide managers with reference points for making the necessary decisions and allow them to respond to any impulses affecting the development of the enterprise. To rank the profitability indicators of business entities we have chosen the activities of agricultural enterprises. Using methods of mathematical modelling, taxonomic analysis and ranking, we have analysed the dynamics of agricultural enterprises’ performance indicators. The testing of some statistical functions made it possible to forecast the rating indicator of agrarian enterprises’ activity in 2023–2024. The result of the profitability and costs ranking of agri-businesses for the reporting year 2020 showed an increase compared to previous years. At the same time, it is possible to observe an increase in expenditures by enterprises, which indicates the need for stricter and deeper monitoring of the activities of agribusiness-es by top managers. This monitoring will prevent bankruptcy or inefficient allocation of finances by the enterprises. The profitability and costs ranking of agribusinesses described in the article is a universal method, applicable to any facility or industry. Ranking can be tested not only in studies of statistical units or their totality but also for determining dynamic changes in retrospective time series. The forecasting of the investigated indicators can serve as impulses for managers concerning the improvement of strategic orientation and making correct decisions by managers of agricultural enterprises with the purpose of forming the goals of further activity.",271579442,1,11,,

However, significant hurdles remain regarding its effectiveness, standardization, and authenticity. This work aims to develop a framework containing recommendations to overcome these hurdles and enable more effective ESG practices. To this end, a systematic literature review (SLR) was adopted as the research method to provide an organized and in-depth overview of the current state of the art in the ESG literature and its main gaps. Through the SLR, 35 hurdles were identified, organized into five axes: integration, assessment, stakeholders, territoriality, and sectorization. Building on these hurdles, a framework comprising 39 recommendations was proposed, targeting the ESG key players: companies, rating agencies, guideline developers, academia, and other stakeholders. As a theoretical contribution, this work articulates previously fragmented knowledge on ESG, helping to bridge the identified research gap, outlining pathways for further and deeper reflections, especially in relation to the persistent decoupling between expected and achieved results in sustainability. As practical contributions, it helps avoid negative impacts for ESG key players, leading them to achieve more realistic assessments, adopt better practices, and increase comparability across initiatives, supporting ESG to reach greater effectiveness, enhance assessment metrics, increase the consistency of reporting, broaden stakeholder engagement, and strengthen institutional mechanisms.",290879853,2,77,,

10.1007/s44274-025-00490-6,Operationalising Green Sukuk within the World Bank environmental and social framework,Wan Mohd Zulhafiz Wan Zahari,Discover Environment,2025,"Abstract This paper examines the integration of Green Sukuk—Shariah-compliant sustainable finance instruments—into the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF). Green Sukuk have emerged as innovative vehicles for mobilising capital towards renewable energy, climate adaptation, and sustainable infrastructure, yet they currently lack formal recognition within the ESF. Drawing on doctrinal legal analysis, comparative case studies of Malaysia and Indonesia, and policy evaluation, this study argues that formal ESF recognition would elevate Green Sukuk from voluntary ethical instruments to enforceable tools within the global sustainable finance framework. The analysis identifies key challenges of legal enforceability, regulatory fragmentation, and governance inconsistencies, and proposes a six-pillar strategy encompassing ESF-compatible issuance guidelines, harmonised regulatory approaches, dual Shariah–ESF compliance statements, enhanced impact measurement through digital tools, targeted incentives and capacity building, and multilateral support with risk-sharing mechanisms. Comparative lessons from Malaysia’s corporate-led model and Indonesia’s sovereign issuances demonstrate transferable pathways for aligning Green Sukuk with ESF safeguards. By integrating Islamic finance principles with international sustainability standards, the paper proposes a dual-assurance model that enhances transparency, mitigates greenwashing risks, and expands financial inclusion in Muslim-majority markets. The findings contribute to both Islamic finance and sustainable development scholarship by offering the first systematic framework for embedding Green Sukuk into the ESF, thereby extending their role in advancing the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.",294709404,1,11,,

It generally focuses on identifying the relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP), although the CSP-CFP link is not investigated enough in the context of changes in dividend payments. Purpose of the article: The paper aims to identify the relationship between CSP and changes in dividend payouts. To do this, a research hypothesis was formulated, stating that improving CSP in environmental, social, governance, and economic dimensions increases the propensity to pay stable dividends. Methods: The main empirical research method is the panel logistic regression model, which includes variables of corporate sustainability. Additionally, descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation coefficients are analyzed. The empirical research was conducted using data on the top global companies listed in the Global 500 of 2021 from the period of 2011–2021. All required data were retrieved from the Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters) Eikon database. Findings &amp; Value added: The main conclusion of the paper is that when all dimensions of corporate sustainability are integrated in the long run, only the strong effectiveness of corporate systems and processes inside a company make board members maintain dividends at the previous levels. It means that the research hypothesis cannot be confirmed for all corporate sustainability dimensions considered together. The value added of the paper is that the authors considered the long-term returns pillar score as one of the independent variables, which is not a commonly used approach, although economic sustainability is a key corporate sustainability dimension.",286338733,2,67,,

Firms currently grapple with fragmented ESG frameworks and overlapping disclosure mandates, which heighten reporting burdens and exacerbate information asymmetry. Through a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of 276 peer‐reviewed articles, this research uncovers significant redundancies in sustainability reporting and a pronounced imbalance between the established TCFD literature and the nascent TNFD scholarship. The study reveals that embedding biodiversity risks within climate disclosures enhances corporate resilience, transparency, and strategic adaptability. A critical theoretical synthesis drawing on legitimacy, stakeholder, institutional, agency, and signaling theories demonstrates that aligning TCFD and TNFD frameworks fosters coherent, credible, and cost‐effective reporting. This integration not only streamlines compliance but also strengthens investor confidence and governance quality. By mapping thematic clusters and identifying disclosure challenges, governance drivers, and adaptive strategies, the study offers a timely and original contribution to sustainability discourse.

This study examines the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance on financing costs among Chinese non-financial listed firms, with a focus on the moderating roles of financial regulation and ESG rating divergence. Using a panel dataset of 4493 firms across 33,773 firm–year observations from 2011 to 2022, we employ a two-way fixed effects model, along with Propensity Score Matching and Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) techniques, to address endogeneity concerns and enhance causal inference. The findings reveal that improvements in ESG performance significantly reduce financing costs, substantially affecting debt relative to equity. Moreover, the cost-saving benefits of ESG are amplified in industries with stronger regulatory oversight, while high ESG rating divergence undermines these benefits by increasing uncertainty. These results highlight the importance of standardizing ESG rating systems and enhancing regulatory consistency. Such efforts can lower capital costs and improve financial access for firms, particularly in capital-intensive and environmentally sensitive sectors, offering actionable guidance for policymakers shaping disclosure frameworks and corporate managers optimizing ESG investment strategies.",288168736,2,63,,

Nevertheless, its capacity and implications for use cases in high-stakes, non-stationary environments — like financial markets — have been empirically under-researched (Tan et al., 2023; Lin & Marques, 2024). This research paper examines generative AI’s zero-shot forecasting capabilities using two large language model (LLM) architectures, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, as they forecast stock prices. Specifically, the paper evaluates the LLMs’ predictive powers in terms of actual closing prices for a portfolio of in-use equities across sectors on February 3, 2025. A rigorous quantitative approach is used throughout the analyses. In the results section, standardized metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation scores, and R-squared are calculated to assess predictive accuracy and directional bias. Results show that Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed GPT-4o on all accuracy metrics, and also showed better accuracy in forecasting actual movement in the stock market, confirming the study hypothesis and demonstrating performance can vary significantly between LLM architectures (Xu et al., 2024). Further analysis of sector-based performance can be undertaken. The study concludes that while the LLM Claude 3.5 Sonnet does yield encouraging strategic implications for use in investment analytics, there still exist significant challenges in relation to interpretability, model calibration, and model sensitivity to rapidly changing market dynamics.",295507755,1,28,,

Evidence from a developing country","Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Muhammad Waqas Nazir, Fawad Rauf, Athar Marwat, Khwaja Naveed",Discover Sustainability,2025,"Abstract In the era of the green revolution, the purpose of the study is to rapidly transform the global economic landscape and emphasize ESG performance integration to enhance corporate profitability and competitiveness. The current study examines 3,846 firm-year observations of non-financial companies in a developing country namely China, which are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2016 to 2022. However, the wide range of research across various fields has led to a lack of clarity within the academic community regarding relationships between ESG performance, corporate commitment, competitiveness, and profitability in the context of China. Recent discussions on corporate commitment, competitiveness, and profitability metrics have brought greater attention to ESG performance, yet they have also contributed to growing misunderstandings of the concept. Additionally, vague definitions and constructs may hinder managers from effectively setting ESG performance objectives for their organizations. Utilizing data from credible sources, including Bloomberg, this research evaluates ESG performance through a comprehensive ESG score and examines its relationship with corporate profitability, and commitment. Hence, the study employs robust methods (i.e. OLS regressions) to assess ESG practice’s impact on corporate outcomes, considering various control variables like return on assets, firm age, financial leverage, ownership concentration, etc. The quantitative findings suggest that ESG performance positively correlates with enhanced corporate performance (β = 0.0.42, p &lt; 0.001), increased market competitiveness (β = 0.08, p-value = 0.001), and strengthened corporate commitment (β = −0.009, p-value = 0.002), thereby underscoring the importance of sustainable practices in achieving long-term business success.

This study proposes a comprehensive model for the implementation of blockchain technology tailored to the unique demands of the FMCG supply chain. The model emphasizes transparency, accountability, and real-time data sharing among stakeholders, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. By integrating blockchain, the FMCG industry can create a tamper-proof record of each transaction and product movement, significantly improving traceability from production to point-of-sale. Key components of the proposed model include a decentralized ledger that captures product information, provenance data, and transaction history. This approach facilitates efficient tracking of products, enhances supply chain visibility, and enables stakeholders to authenticate goods at any stage. Moreover, by employing blockchain’s smart contract functionality, the model allows for automated compliance verification and streamlined processes, reducing the time and resources required for audits and inspections. The study further explores potential extensions of blockchain technology to incorporate smart contracts that can automate various supply chain operations. These contracts can facilitate automatic payments upon delivery confirmation, trigger inventory replenishment orders based on real-time data, and enforce compliance with regulatory requirements without human intervention. By leveraging these technological advancements, FMCG companies can significantly reduce counterfeit losses and improve overall supply chain efficiency. This not only protects brand reputation but also fosters consumer trust, which is vital in an increasingly competitive market. The implications of this research highlight the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the FMCG sector, paving the way for future innovations in traceability and efficiency. In conclusion, this study presents a robust framework for blockchain implementation in the FMCG supply chain, addressing critical issues of traceability and counterfeiting while offering pathways for future enhancements through smart contracts.",281084013,2,216,,
10.1177/21582440251361212,Why Do Investors Behave Irrationally in the Cryptocurrency and Emerging Stock Markets?,Mateusz Skwarek,SAGE Open,2025,"The popularity of cryptocurrencies as alternative investments has grown in recent years. However, it remains unclear whether cryptocurrency investors behave irrationally in a similar way to emerging market investors. Using a systematic literature review, this study aims to compare the factors related to the presence of behavioural biases in the cryptocurrency and emerging stock markets. This study highlights similarities and differences between cryptocurrency and emerging stock market investor behaviour. Thus, the study's novelty arises from comparing the role of behavioural inclinations in cryptocurrency and emerging stock markets. The findings indicate that the small amount or lack of available information about small-cap emerging stocks or cryptocurrencies may reinforce investor sentiment and herding behaviour. The herding behaviour among investors in both markets may stem from following the most popular investment trends. Investors in cryptocurrency and emerging stock markets also tend to overreact to market sentiment and changes in market conditions. Extreme market conditions may affect the strength of herding behaviour, disposition effect, price clustering, anomalous behaviour, investor sentiment and uncertainty. Thus, cryptocurrency and emerging stock markets are informationally inefficient most of the time, whilst investors’ irrationality may be more pronounced during certain periods. Furthermore, investors’ behaviour in the cryptocurrency and emerging stock markets is more consistent with the adaptive market hypothesis than the efficient market hypothesis. This research suggests that cryptocurrency and emerging stock market investors should actively manage investment portfolios. Policymakers should be more concerned about information accessibility and quality, especially in the case of small-cap investment assets. JEL codes: G14;G15;G41",289615939,1,216,,

This paper presents a controlled evaluation of five transformer-based LLMs applied to question answering over the Business sections of U.S. 10-K filings. To capture complementary aspects of model behavior, we combine human evaluation, automated similarity metrics, and behavioral diagnostics under standardized and context-controlled prompting conditions. Human assessments indicate that models differ in their average performance across qualitative dimensions such as relevance, completeness, clarity, conciseness, and factual accuracy, though inter-rater agreement is modest, reflecting the subjective nature of these criteria. Automated metrics reveal systematic differences in lexical overlap and semantic similarity across models, while behavioral diagnostics highlight variation in response stability and cross-prompt alignment. Importantly, no single model consistently dominates across all evaluation perspectives. Together, these findings suggest that apparent performance differences should be interpreted as relative tendencies under the tested conditions rather than definitive indicators of general reliability. The results underscore the need for evaluation frameworks that account for human disagreement, behavioral variability, and interpretability when deploying LLMs in financially consequential applications.",289669042,1,41,,

This study explores how external forces and internal practices shape sustainable tourism management among technology-based SMEs in Bangladesh. Using the Stimulus–Organism–Response (SOR) framework, we examine how institutional requirements, market competition, and green human resource management influence the adoption of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and business analytics capability. These, in turn, affect sustainable tourism management performance. The analysis is based on 760 SMEs using structural equation modeling (SEM), propensity score matching (PSM), and fuzzy-set qualitative-comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results show that institutional pressure, market competition, and green human resource management all play an important role in encouraging SMEs to adopt ESG practices and develop business analytics capability. Both ESG adoption and analytics, in turn, make a strong contribution to sustainable tourism performance. The PSM analysis, which compares firms with high and low levels of ESG and analytics, confirms these findings: SMEs that adopt ESG practices achieve about 19% higher sustainability scores, while those with strong analytics capability perform about 17% better than others. The fsQCA results further reveal that there is no single path to achieving sustainability. Instead, different combinations of ESG practices, analytics capability, and competitive conditions can all lead to strong outcomes, highlighting the diverse strategies SMEs can follow.

However, addressing information that is not included in training data remains a challenge, particularly in nuclear medicine, where examination protocols are frequently updated and vary across institutions. In this study, we developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using 40 internal manuals from a single Japanese hospital, each corresponding to a different examination in nuclear medicine. These institution-specific documents were segmented and indexed using a hybrid retrieval strategy combining dense vector search (text-embedding-3-small) and sparse keyword search (BM25). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o were used with the OpenAI application programming interface (API) for response generation. The quality of the generated answers was assessed using a four-point Likert scale by three certified radiological technologists, of which one held an additional certification in nuclear medicine and another held an additional certification in medical physics. Automated evaluation was conducted using RAGAS metrics, including factual correctness and context recall. The GPT-4o model combined with hybrid retrieval achieved the highest performance, as per expert evaluations. Although traditional string-based metrics such as ROUGE and the Levenshtein distance poorly align with human ratings, RAGAS provided consistent rankings across system configurations, despite showing only a modest correlation with manual scores. These findings demonstrate that integrating examination-specific institutional manuals into RAG frameworks can effectively support domain-specific question answering in nuclear medicine. Moreover, LLM-based evaluation methods such as RAGAS may serve as practical tools to complement expert reviews in developing healthcare-oriented artificial intelligence systems.

The index is calculated by evaluating the tone (positive or negative) of each firm’s annual ESG news coverage. Results The results reveal a significant negative correlation between corporate ESG media coverage and the cost of equity, where more positive coverage is associated with a lower financing cost. Mechanism analysis confirms that stronger ESG performance can reduce equity costs by enhancing the transparency of corporate information. Heterogeneity analysis further shows that this negative relationship is more pronounced in state-owned and large firms. Discussion The findings provide empirical evidence for the relationship between ESG news coverage and the cost of equity, validating this link in the context of an emerging market. These results offer new insights into how ESG engagement improves capital market efficiency and supports the broader goals of sustainable and responsible investment.",286041746,1,53,,

However, with the growing popularity of E-commerce, people are now shifting towards E-agriculture for purchase of Agri-inputs like fertilizer, seed, plant protection chemicals etc. Online purchase of agriculture machinery and equipment has also gained momentum in the last few years. The research focuses on the profile of customers who shop the Agri-products based on various dimensions of online shopping as well as their demographic characteristics. The data collected has been analyzed based on stepwise cluster analysis and their profiles have been identified based on the results. Basically, four clusters of shoppers which are identified namely surgical shoppers-giving more importance to merchandise information and reliability attributes of online shopping; digitally driven shoppers-concerned about convenience and interactivity attributes; power shoppers-have more inclination towards navigation attribute; and reluctant shoppers- more affected by navigation and reliability attributes. Other than this promotions attribute which includes discounts, free gifts, attractive packaging, and combo packs is equally important for all the customers expect reluctant shoppers. Similarly design attributes which include colors, borders, graphics, pictures, styles, and fonts are also equally preferred by all shoppers except shoppers who belong to the reluctant shoppers. The present study aims to understand online consumer shopping behavior patterns for agriculture products to make the E-agribusiness stronger and more prominent in the country.",268368131,2,13,,

This has been restricting the development of modern AIS. Based on this, first, this paper studies the influence of the knowledge economy on accounting innovation and in the innovation economy. The process of confirmation for accounting elements in economic business, under the traditional AIS, is analyzed. Then, the model of the accounting element confirmation, i.e., BPNN, is constructed by combining the backpropagation (BP) neural network (NN) theory with the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. Finally, we simulate the confirmation process of accounting elements based on the economic business data of specific online stores. The experimental outcomes illustrate that under the proposed BPNN model, the output value of the accounting entry is also increasing and has been in the interval [0, 0.14] with the continuous increase in the input value of economic business activities. Moreover, the overall simulation error of economic business activity data does not exceed 0.3% in the simulation test of the proposed accounting business data confirmation model based on the BPNN algorithm. The empirical outcomes indicate that the model has high accuracy and reliability. The purpose is to realize the identification of business events by machines and complete the automatic confirmation of accounting elements in the back-end economic business of online stores.

In Indonesia, firms possess a poor comprehension of the impact that integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) measures into corporate strategy has on long-term value generation, resilience, and profitability. This study seeks to delineate the role of ESG in enhancing financial performance and sustainable growth within Indonesian firms. Researchers utilize purposive sampling to identify organizations that have consistently disclosed sustainability metrics in accordance with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements for a duration of five years. The population comprised 938 publicly listed companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), with 38 selected enterprises that consistently reported. This research does a comprehensive panel regression analysis using financial data sourced from the Bloomberg Terminal. The study reveals a complex relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosures and corporate financial success, particularly in emerging markets like Indonesia. It suggests that while firms prioritize governance transparency, its impact on financial performance may be temporary, affecting short-term profitability.

This study employs SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to systematically compare the predictive performance and interpretability of five mainstream machine learning models in financial classification tasks. Using a real financial dataset containing 24 financial indicators to train logistic regression, five machine learning models - logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and support vector machine - are trained on this dataset. SHAP is then applied to analyse the feature importance patterns across models. Empirical results demonstrate that LightGBM achieves the best predictive performance (accuracy 95.90%, Area Under the Curve (AUC) 99.18%), while XGBoost shows advantages in terms of interpretability. SHAP analysis identifies those prior earnings per share is the most critical feature, and the Top-K overlap analysis reveals a high degree of consistency among tree-based models in feature importance recognition.

Herrera-Viedma",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,2024,"The use of social network to model the evolution of credit scores of networked enterprises is still a challenging task. This article develops an opinion dynamics model of the evolution of credit scores of enterprises in a social network. Firstly, based on the number of potential cooperated enterprises and the initial credit scores, the leader and follower enterprises are identified. Then, taking into consideration the cooperated benefit and discrimination cost, the cooperated utility between any two enterprises is calculated, which is used to compute the weights that one enterprise assigns to other enterprises. An opinion dynamics model on the evolution of credit scores of enterprises, inspired on the classical Friedkin–Johnsen’s social network model, is developed. Some desirable properties of the proposed opinion dynamics model are theoretically stated and proved. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed opinion dynamics model, while a simulation analysis to investigate the joint influences of the connection probabilities and the network structure on the evolution of credit scores of enterprises is reported.",269453361,2,31,,

These enterprises are implementing measures to trace and track raw materials and components, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards and ethical sourcing practices. This transparency is crucial in identifying and mitigating environmental and social risks within the supply chain. However, it is important to note that there is still a lack of extensive research in the context of China regarding sustainable practices in global supply chains. While some studies and initiatives have been conducted, there is a need for more comprehensive research to understand the specific challenges and opportunities faced by Chinese enterprises in adopting and implementing sustainable practices throughout their supply chains. The objective of this study is investigating the research progress on issue related Sustainable Practices in Global Supply Chains of Chinese Enterprises. In doing so, systematic literature research was implemented on the supply chains of Chinese enterprises' foreign direct investment (FDI) to provides insights into the penetration and significance of sustainable concepts in this topic. This paper utilizes advanced data visualization techniques and an in-depth literature review to comprehensively summarize and review previous research extracted from the Web of Science database.  The study included 518 articles and analyzed them through RStudio and VOSviewer software.

The tested hypotheses' results provide empirical evidence supporting these hypotheses, with R 2 values ranging from 0.5149 to 0.7719. H1 achieved the highest explanatory power ( R 2 = 0.7719, 77.19% variance), followed by H2 ( R 2 ≈ 0.75) and H3 ( R 2 ≈ 0.73), while H4 showed moderate effects ( R 2 = 0.5149). Findings indicate that machine learning models demonstrated strong predictive relationships between fraud risk management and environmental outcomes. All hypotheses were supported, showing that fraud management significantly influences environmental disclosures and stewardship. Thus, organizations can leverage fraud controls to enhance environmental performance. In addition, utilizing data‐driven approaches enables targeted policy interventions and operational improvements in Nigeria's oil sector.

This review examines the evolution, architecture, and applications of hybrid systems that integrate LLMs with traditional predictive models to address complex challenges in financial forecasting, risk management, and portfolio optimization. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled LLMs to extract nuanced sentiment and contextual information from vast textual datasets, while deep learning (DL) architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and transformer-based models have demonstrated superior performance in capturing temporal dependencies within financial time series. The integration of these technologies through early, intermediate, and late fusion strategies has yielded hybrid architectures that leverage the complementary strengths of linguistic understanding and numerical prediction. This paper synthesizes current research on financial LLMs including BloombergGPT and FinGPT, explores attention mechanisms and multimodal data fusion techniques, and evaluates the application of these hybrid systems across sentiment analysis, stock prediction, portfolio management, and fraud detection. Critical challenges including explainability, regulatory compliance, computational efficiency, and data quality are examined alongside emerging solutions. The review concludes that hybrid architectures combining LLMs and predictive analytics represent the future of financial modeling, offering enhanced accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability to dynamic market conditions, while emphasizing the need for continued research in model transparency, ethical AI deployment, and standardized evaluation frameworks.",292441882,1,65,,

Its impact extends to areas such as productivity, employment, innovation, and economic growth. However, there is also a risk that it will displace jobs and exacerbate inequalities. These inequalities can contribute to the creation of a wider gap between developed and developing countries. Nations with developed economies tend to adapt more quickly to artificial intelligence, giving them a competitive advantage over other countries. This research paper uses a mixed quantitative-qualitative methodology, conducting a bibliographic review of databases such as Scielo, Google Scholar, and Latindex. It also analyzes existing data on AI and interviews experts about possible solutions to reduce the gap it can generate. As a result, it can be seen that developed countries are better positioned to implement artificial intelligence, given their wealth, which allows them to invest in infrastructure, human capital, and innovation. However, developing countries can address the challenges this entails through policies and avoid being left behind.",292484127,1,7,,

This study aims to investigate the interaction effect between offering supply chain finance (SCF) programmes and sustainability ratings on the liquidity performance of buyers and suppliers.

Design/methodology/approach
The study uses a unique sample of buyers that each have an SCF programme. The sample is complemented with financial information and sustainability scores. The data is analysed through a random effects model.

Findings
Aligning with recent advances in SCF literature, the results confirm a tendency for SCF programmes to favour buyers over suppliers. However, the relationship between SCF programme adoption and liquidity performance for buyers and suppliers is positively moderated by the strong sustainability performance of both parties.

Practical implications
Buyers and suppliers are advised to implement and adopt effective SCF programmes that are beneficial for both parties. For buyers, the authors suggest leveraging on SCF programmes as incentives to foster sustainable behaviour among suppliers. For suppliers, the authors recommend caution before joining programmes offered by buyers that do not perform well on sustainability.

Social implications
Enhancing sustainability within global supply chains and fostering favourable payment practices towards suppliers are crucial for policy development and regulation. The findings clarify the connection between both components, offering valuable insights for policymakers in this domain.

Originality/value
The study is built on a manually picked, unique database of buyers offering SCF programmes to their suppliers. This allows, across a large sample, an evaluation of the differences between buyers that offer SCF programmes and those that do not.

This framework bridges predictive analytics with stakeholder-informed behavioral insights to promote inclusive innovation aligned with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods design is used. The quantitative phase uses recursive feature elimination and LightGBM to develop a high-performing predictive model using an anonymized data set from a US-based insurer. The qualitative phase involves semi-structured interviews, thematic analysis and causal loop diagrams to explore the psychological, cultural and institutional factors influencing insurance adoption and resistance. The findings of this study were integrated to form the INSPIRE framework. Findings The hybrid model demonstrated superior accuracy (AUC = 0.962), enabling effective segmentation and targeting. Qualitative findings revealed that trust, communication quality, risk awareness and peer influence adoption behavior. The INSPIRE framework consolidates these findings into a structured model that includes cognitive and structural enablers, mediating perceptions (transparency, engagement and reliability) and moderating variables (literacy, income, geography and gender) to explain adoption outcomes. Research limitations/implications The study’s findings are based on data from a U.S. insurer, which limits their generalizability across different regions and regulatory settings. The qualitative insights are derived from a modest participant pool, which may not accurately reflect broader stakeholder perspectives. While the hybrid model is highly accurate, its interpretability remains limited, posing challenges for non-technical stakeholders. Future research should validate the model in diverse markets, enhance transparency using tools such as SHAP or LIME, and investigate long-term deployment outcomes. Additional work is needed to integrate behavioral insights into predictive logic and assess real-world impact on financial inclusion and policy effectiveness. Practical implications This study provides a robust decision-support tool for insurers by integrating machine learning and behavioral insights through the INSPIRE framework. The hybrid model enhances targeting, improves customer segmentation, and supports the delivery of personalized insurance offerings. It enables ethical deployment of predictive analytics by addressing trust, literacy, and access barriers. Insurers can invest in simplified communication, digital infrastructure, and community engagement to increase adoption. The model enhances operational efficiency and aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting financial inclusion and equitable service delivery, particularly in underserved regions. This approach is beneficial for firms seeking scalable, responsible, and data-driven insurance innovation. Social implications By identifying underserved groups and understanding behavioral barriers, the model supports SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry and Innovation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality) and SDG 16 (Justice and Strong Institutions). Through human-centered design, this study promotes inclusive access to financial safety nets and fosters trust in digital financial systems. Originality/value This study contributes a novel conceptual framework that combines ML with human-centered insights to enable responsible and inclusive insurance innovation. The INSPIRE framework operationalizes behavioral drivers within a predictive model, bridging technical accuracy with stakeholder needs and expanding the application of predictive analytics within management and insurance research.

 Agentic artificial intelligence (AAI) represents a significant evolution in the field of AI, moving beyond traditional and generative systems toward models characterized by autonomy, adaptivity, proactiveness, and decision agency. Unlike earlier AI paradigms that were reactive or limited to narrow tasks, AAI integrates reasoning, memory, planning, and tool orchestration to pursue complex objectives with minimal human oversight. Using a systematic literature review method, this study synthesizes current knowledge on AAI by examining its conceptual foundations, practical applications, and emerging research directions. Conceptually, AAI is distinguished from automation, generative AI, and multi‐agent systems through its unique capacity to operate as a socio‐technical partner in organizational and societal contexts. In practice, AAI is being applied across sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education, and sustainability, enabling organizations to enhance decision support, optimize processes, and improve resilience in global business contexts. However, these advancements present significant challenges, including governance, transparency, accountability, workforce transformation, and integration with legacy systems. On the research front, four major streams dominate current scholarship: human–AI collaboration and co‐agency; balancing AI autonomy with human control; governance and trust; and societal and ethical implications. To unify these insights, this paper develops an antecedent–mechanism–outcome framework linking technological, organizational, and societal enablers to the mechanisms and outcomes of AAI adoption. Building on this synthesis, a future research agenda is proposed that emphasizes conceptual refinement, responsible integration, methodological innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Overall, the study contributes to both academic and managerial understanding in the global business context by highlighting AAI as both a driver of business strategy and a potential enabler of organizational excellence and sustainable development.",293130873,1,47,,

The “Account Age” variable, standing for financial inclusion, is the share of adults owning accounts with formal financial institutions or with the providers of mobile money services, inclusive of both conventional and digital entry points. Methodologically, the article follows an econometric approach with panel data regressions, supplemented by Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with instrumental variables in order to control endogeneity biases. ESG-specific instruments like climate resilience indicators and digital penetration measures are utilized for the purpose of robustness. As a companion approach, the paper follows machine learning techniques, applying a set of algorithms either for regression or for clustering for the purpose of detecting non-linearities and discerning ESG-inclusion typologies for the sample of countries. Results reflect that financial inclusion is, in the Environmental pillar, significantly associated with contemporary sustainability activity such as consumption of green energy, extent of protected area, and value added by agriculture, while reliance on traditional agriculture, measured by land use and value added by agriculture, decreases inclusion. For the Social pillar, expenditure on education, internet, sanitation, and gender equity are prominent inclusion facilitators, while engagement with the informal labor market exhibits a suppressing function. For the Governance pillar, anti-corruption activity and patent filing activity are inclusive, while diminishing regulatory quality, possibly by way of digital governance gaps, has a negative correlation. Policy implications are substantial: the research suggests that development dividends from a multi-dimensional approach can be had through enhancing financial inclusion. Policies that intersect financial access with upgrading the environment, social expenditure, and institutional reconstitution can simultaneously support sustainability targets. These are the most applicable lessons for the policy-makers and development professionals concerned with the attainment of the SDGs, specifically over the regions of the Global South, where the trinity of climate resilience, social fairness, and institutional renovation most significantly manifests.",288459424,0,104,,

This case study examines the spatial dimension of retail-driven land-use transformation by analyzing supermarket expansion in the Veneto region (northern Italy), with a focus on a large grocery retailer. We evaluated its corporate environmental claims by assessing land consumption patterns from 1983 to 2024 using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The GIS-based methodology involved geocoding 113 Points of Sale (POS—individual retail outlets), performing photo-interpretation of historical aerial imagery, and classifying land-cover types prior to construction. We applied spatial metrics such as total converted surface area, land-cover class frequency across eight categories (e.g., agricultural, herbaceous, arboreal), and the average linear distance between afforestation sites and POS developed on previously rural land. Our findings reveal that 65.97% of the total land converted for Points of Sale development occurred in rural areas, primarily agricultural and herbaceous lands. These landscapes play a critical role in supporting urban biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services, which are increasingly threatened by unchecked land conversion. While the corporate sustainability reports and marketing strategies emphasize afforestation efforts under their “We Love Nature” initiative, our spatial analysis uncovers no evidence of actual land-use conversion. Additionally, reforestation activities are located an average of 40.75 km from converted sites, undermining their role as effective compensatory measures. These findings raise concerns about selective disclosure and greenwashing, driving the need for more comprehensive and transparent corporate sustainability reporting. The study argues for stronger policy frameworks to incentivize urban regeneration over greenfield development and calls for the integration of land-use data into corporate sustainability disclosures. By combining geospatial methods with content analysis, the research offers new insights into the intersection of land use, business practices, and environmental sustainability in climate-vulnerable regions.",289213968,0,37,,

10.3390/su17219791,Does ESG Uncertainty Disrupt Inventory Management? Evidence from an Emerging Market,S. Aldawsari,Sustainability,2025,"The growing prominence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations has introduced new challenges for firms worldwide. While ESG practices are often framed as long-term drivers of competitiveness, uncertainty surrounding their regulatory requirements has created significant operational risks. The primary objective of this study is to examine how ESG uncertainty (ESG) affects inventory management in listed firms. The study analyzed data from Chinese A-share listed companies over the period 2010 to 2024. A series of econometric estimations, including fixed effect models, two-stage least squares (2SLS), and system GMM, were employed to ensure the robustness of the results and to address issues of heteroscedasticity, endogeneity, and dynamic effects. The empirical results consistently revealed that ESG uncertainty exerted a significant negative effect on inventory management. Firms facing greater unpredictability in ESG-related requirements experienced disruptions in supply chain coordination, difficulties in demand forecasting, and inefficiencies in inventory turnover. Beyond this, larger firms and those with higher environmental expenditures exhibited weaker inventory efficiency, while debt ratio, cost of capital, and firm performance were positively associated with improved inventory outcomes. For corporate managers, the study highlighted the importance of embedding sustainability considerations into inventory strategies and adopting flexible procurement systems, predictive analytics, and stronger governance mechanisms. The findings underscored the broader societal need for clarity and stability in ESG regulations. For this, reducing policy unpredictability could enable firms to align sustainability commitments with operational efficiency, thereby improving competitiveness while minimizing waste and resource misallocation. This study was among the first to empirically establish the link between ESG uncertainty and inventory management, bridging the gap between sustainability research and operational efficiency.",292243141,1,34,,

Even though AI soft skills are becoming more important, no scale specifically designed to identify and evaluate individuals’ AI soft skills has been found in the existing literature. Therefore, this paper aimed to develop a reliable and valid scale to identify the AI soft skills of individuals. A sample of 685 individuals who were employed in AI-active sectors, with a minimum of a bachelor’s degree, and at least one year of AI-related work experience, participated in the study. A sequential exploratory mixed-methods research design was utilized. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified a five-factor structure that accounted for 67.37% of the total variation, including persuasion, collaboration, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and creativity. Factor loadings ranged from 0.621 to 0.893, and communalities ranged from 0.587 to 0.875. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported this structure, with strong model fit indices (GFI = 0.940, AGFI = 0.947, NFI = 0.949, PNFI = 0.833, PGFI = 0.823, TLI = 0.972, IFI = 0.975, CFI = 0.975, RMSEA = 0.052, SRMR = 0.035). Internal consistency for each factor was high, with Cronbach’s alpha values of dimensions ranging from 0.804 to 0.875, with a value of 0.921 for the overall scale. Convergent and discriminant validity analyses further confirmed the construct’s robustness. The finalized AI soft skills (AISS) scale, consisting of 24 items, offers a psychometrically valid and reliable tool for assessing essential AI soft skills in professional contexts. Ultimately, this developed scale enables the determination of the social and cognitive skills needed in the human-centered and participatory governance structures of smart cities, supporting the achievement of specific Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG 4, SDG 8, and SDG 11, and contributes to the design of policies and training programs to eliminate the deficiencies of individuals in these areas. Thus, it becomes possible to create qualified human resources that support sustainable development in smart cities, and for these individuals to take an active part in the labor market.",289734526,0,78,,

In controlled settings, detection accuracies of greater than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as personalised transformer models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is also problematic and, to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data, and because few multilingual text-processing infrastructures are in place.

As fundamental microeconomic entities, enterprises play a crucial role in the national governance of carbon emissions. This study uses panel data on Chinese A share listed companies from 2019 to 2023 and employs fixed effects models that control for firm, year, and industry effect to analyze how ESG performance influences carbon emissions and through which mechanism. The findings indicate that improvements in ESG ratings significantly reduce firms’ carbon emissions. This effect operates primarily through the following two channels: (1) promoting green technological innovation, thereby enhancing environmental performance, and (2) increasing the attention of financial analysts, which strengthens external monitoring. The heterogeneity analysis further reveals that the mitigating effect of ESG improvement on carbon emissions is more pronounced in firms with a lower proportion of institutional ownership, while this effect is relatively weaker in firms with higher institutional ownership. This suggests that in contexts where institutional investors hold a smaller share, firms may place greater emphasis on the policy pressure and social responsibility expectations associated with ESG performance, thereby exhibiting stronger commitment to emission reduction actions. In contrast, in firms dominated by institutional investors, the implementation of ESG policy objectives may be partially compromised due to the investors’ short-term profit orientation. This study provides empirical evidence for firms to fulfill their environmental and social responsibilities and offers actionable insights for investors aiming to promote sustainable development. From a policy perspective, the findings also offer theoretical support for developing differentiated regulatory strategies based on variations in ownership and shareholding structures.",289891655,1,71,,

The population in this study are all companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2024 with purposive sampling. Observation data amounted to 92 non-financial companies. Data were collected from the company's financial statements and annual reports. Multiple regression tests were used to analyze this research. The results showed that the presence of firm value and company website has a significant effect on voluntary disclosure. This finding indicates that firm values and company websites influence voluntary disclosure. Digital transparency has a significant role in encouraging voluntary disclosure by firms in Indonesia; increased digital transparency not only strengthens stakeholder trust but also positively contributes to increased firm value. In conclusion, digital transparency significantly increases firm value through a positive influence on the level of voluntary disclosure. The findings suggest that companies in Indonesia that effectively implement digital transparency tend to be more open in disclosing information, thereby strengthening investor confidence and improving corporate reputation.

Kumar",Studies in Economics and Finance,2025,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the impact of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) components on firm value (FV) in Nifty 50 firms. Furthermore, it explores how the Climate change risk, a key aspect of SDG 13 (Climate Action), moderates the relationship between ESG disclosures (ESGD) components and FV. Moreover, it examines the heterogeneity of results among high-low polluting industries; it aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and how firms with different pollution levels integrate sustainable production practices with economic motives. Design/methodology/approach The pooled OLS model with industry effect is applied to panel data of 50 Nifty Indian firms from 2017 to 2023. The climate vulnerability index is used as a moderating variable to investigate the moderating impact of climate change risk on the relationship between ESGD components and FV. Industries are classified into high and low-polluting industries as per norms of the Central Pollution Control Board of India. Furthermore, 2SLS, two step system GMM estimation and alternative measure robustness test are conducted. Findings The study explored the negative impact of Environment (ENV) and Governance (GOV) performance on the value of nifty 50 firms; climate vulnerability magnifies the negative impact of ENV and GOV performance. Higher ENV performance negatively impacts FV in both high and low-polluting industries, but the negative impact is stronger in low-polluting industries. Enhancing GOV and Social (SOC) performance negatively impacts FV only in low-polluting industries. SOC and GOV performance has an insignificant impact in high polluting industries. Moreover, the Climate vulnerability index magnifies the impact of ESGD components on the FV of Nifty 50 firms, high- and low-polluting samples. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to the Indian context and Nifty 50 firms. Furthermore, it can be extended to other emerging countries to have more comprehensive findings. Originality/value The CVI measures a country’s exposure to climate change’s negative impacts. This index is used in the Indian context to assess the moderating impact of climate change on the relationship between ESGD components and FV in high and low-polluting industries.",289891121,0,105,,

It is found that ESG performance is positively correlated with corporate innovation efficiency at a 1% significance level with a correlation coefficient of 0.057, which means that ESG performance can improve corporate innovation efficiency. Government subsidies play a mediating role in the relationship between corporate ESG performance and corporate innovation, and corporate ESG performance can enable enterprises to obtain more government subsidies, which can promote the enhancement of corporate innovation capacity. The results of heterogeneity analysis show that the ESG performance of non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises in the growth period has a more obvious effect on the improvement of corporate innovation efficiency, and their correlation coefficients reach 0.537 and 0.483, respectively. To summarize, based on the enterprise level, exploring the impact and mechanism of ESG performance on green innovation efficiency has important theoretical and practical significance for promoting the transformation of a low-carbon economy.",275201217,0,20,,

This paper examines the relationship between AI information disclosure and changes in institutional investor shareholdings, utilizing data from Chinese A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2007 and 2023. The results indicate that enhanced AI information disclosure is associated with increased institutional investor ownership. This conclusion remains valid following robustness tests that include substituting dependent and independent variables, altering clustering levels, excluding municipal samples, and employing quantile regression. Heterogeneity analyses further reveal that the effect is notably stronger in samples post-2011, within manufacturing firms, in environments with higher competition, and among firms with directors possessing a strong technological background. The mechanism analysis reveals that increased AI information disclosure prompts institutional investors to conduct on-site visits, enhancing information transparency and bolstering innovation capabilities. Further, heightened AI information disclosure is particularly significant in encouraging shareholdings by long-term and resilient institutional investors. This paper presents the first micro-level evidence on the impact of AI disclosure on institutional investor shareholdings, offering theoretical and practical implications for refining investment strategies of institutional investors in the capital market.

10.1371/journal.pone.0331004,The impact of management compliance attention and board faultlines strength on ESG performance: Evidence from Chinese listed companies,"Yong Jiang, Fei Han",PLoS ONE,2025,"Against the backdrop of global sustainable development goals and the rapid evolution of ESG practices in China, this study empirically examines how management compliance attention and board faultlines strength affect ESG performance using data from Chinese A-share listed companies spanning 2010–2022. Using textual analysis of annual reports to measure compliance attention, we employ OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression, moderation, and mediation analyses. The findings reveal three key results: (1) Management compliance attention is positively associated with ESG performance (β = 0.041, p &lt; 0.01); (2) Board faultlines strength significantly amplifies this positive impact (β = 0.114, p &lt; 0.01); (3) Organizational resilience partially mediates the relationship between management compliance attention and ESG performance, as confirmed by a Sobel test (z = 3.089, p = 0.002). Heterogeneity analysis shows that state-owned enterprises exhibit more pronounced compliance-driven ESG improvements, whereas private firms rely on board diversity to enhance such effects. This study contributes to the literature by integrating institutional theory, cognitive theory, upper echelons theory, and dynamic capabilities theory, demonstrating that management compliance attention boosts ESG performance through organizational resilience, with board faultlines acting as a critical moderator. Practical implications include recommendations for firms to strengthen compliance cultures, foster diverse boards, and build organizational resilience, while policymakers should enhance compliance frameworks and ESG disclosure standards to promote sustainable corporate practices.",290441307,0,69,,

Salcedo",Risks,2025,"Traditionally, business risk management models have not taken into consideration household composition for the purposes of credit granting or project financing in order to manage the risk of default. In this research, an improvement in the risk management model was obtained by introducing household composition as a new exogenous variable. With the application of generalized reduced gradient nonlinear optimization modeling, improved consumption units are determined according to the different types of household size and the age of their members. Estimated household economies of scale show a consistent pattern even in the year 2020, corresponding with the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, an adjusted estimation of the household equivalized disposable income is obtained. Based on this more accurate equivalized income estimation, acceptable debt levels can be determined. The estimation of probabilities of default allows the household risk of default to be managed. In this way, a novel model is proposed by incorporating household composition into credit risk evaluation using fuzzy clustering and optimization techniques. Companies can assess the expected loss of a credit exposure through a model that can help them in the process of making evidence-informed decisions.",286112392,0,50,,

Considering the theoretical importance of corporate sustainability performance in the credit rating process, we aimed to develop a data mining model to predict the credit rating of companies, by incorporating ESG data to traditional accounting and financial measures with a sample of 6622 firms. For this purpose, four different classification and regression methods were utilized, i.e., regression analysis (RA), generalized linear model (GLM), CHAID tree analysis (CTA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The comparison of the fitting methods shows that CTA is the most appropriate method for modeling SmartRatios credit rating predictions, since it has the highest correlation coefficient (R) and the lowest relative error. Leverage (LEV) and profitability (ROA) emerged as the most important variables across all methods to predict the credit rating. The ESG pillars, environmental (E), social (S), governance (G), and ESG controversies (C) present a mixed landscape of importance values across the models. Our findings revealed that each component of ESG, environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G), contributes uniquely to predicting credit risk, which emphasizes the significant potential of integrating ESG data to the traditional financial performance indicators to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of credit rating predictions.",286232233,0,95,,

Design/methodology/approach The analysis covers data from 53 Chinese banks from 2010 to 2022. Pooled Ordinary Least Squares and Quantile Panel Regression Models are used to examine the relationship between climate risks and key liquidity metrics, including the Loan-to-Deposit (LTD) ratio and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Findings The results reveal that banks with low LTD ratios expand lending to support green projects. In contrast, banks with high LTD ratios adopt conservative strategies to mitigate risks from rising NPLs and asset volatility. In addition, this study finds that climate risks influence LCR differently across banks: High-LCR banks face asset devaluation risks. While Low-LCRS banks prioritize compliance with regulatory requirements. Research limitations/implications The findings are limited to Chinese banks, which may limit their generalizability to other regions with different banking systems and climate risk exposures. Moreover, the authors primarily address the immediate impacts of climate risks, leaving unexplored the long-term cumulative effects of repeated climate shocks, unpredictable climate events or policy shifts on bank liquidity. Practical implications The findings may help regulatory bodies formulate policies that require banks to integrate climate risk into their liquidity management strategies. This might include mandatory disclosure of climate-related financial risks and adherence to sustainable banking practices. Policymakers can use these findings to develop targeted interventions to support banks in managing climate risks, such as providing incentives for green financing and investments in climate-resilient infrastructure. Social implications The findings have broader societal impacts, influencing public policy and awareness. Strengthening climate risk management within banking can enhance economic stability, protect jobs and support sustainable development. Policymakers can leverage these insights to design regulations that promote responsible lending and investment in climate-resilient infrastructure, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and equitable financial system. Raising awareness of these risks among businesses and the public can encourage proactive risk management and responsible financial decision-making, contributing to the broader goal of sustainable economic development and societal resilience. Originality/value Given China’s unique economic structure, regulatory landscape and climate challenges, this analysis offers a distinctive perspective compared to broader, more generalized studies. Furthermore, the authors use an innovative and novel analytical approach based on the Quantile Panel Regression Model to assess the impact of climate change on bank liquidity, significantly enhancing the originality and depth of this research.",287762121,0,94,,

 In line with the theme of this special issue: Rethinking the Creation of Social Value through Projects, this paper rethinks social value in projects by separating it from related terms such as social procurement and social reporting. The paper adopts an objectivist worldview, rendering social value a set of defined project requirements. From this perspective, this paper develops the social trifecta: a framework that connects social value, social procurement and social reporting as sequential and interdependent tools for creating measurable social outcomes. The aim is to give project teams a clear and accountable way to define, deliver and verify social value through projects.
 
 
 
 This paper employs a systematic literature review, analysing peer-reviewed journal articles, books and reports from reliable databases, and then scoring the most relevant and impactful sources to extract information from. The systematic literature review focused on the themes of social value, social procurement and social reporting. It identified recurring gaps and conceptual inconsistencies. From this systematic literature review, the paper theorised the social trifecta framework to tie up social value with these social constructs and how they can all be used together in a project context to effectively define and deliver social outcomes.
 
 
 
 The study reveals that social value, social procurement and social reporting are often treated as independent constructs and are insufficiently (and inconsistently) defined across the academic literature. This fragmentation limits their conceptual clarity and practicality in delivering measurable and meaningful social outcomes. By presenting them as interdependent and sequential elements that create social outcomes, and then tying them under one framework (i.e. the social trifecta), social value can be transformed from loosely defined and ambitious targets to clear and measurable social outcomes.
 
 
 
 To provide a concise conceptual framework, the paper takes an objectivist view of social value. It introduces the social trifecta as a conceptual framework that connects social value, social procurement and social reporting as distinct but sequentially interdependent constructs. This paper helps project practitioners make sense of social value as a set of project requirements, definitions and targets that are interdependently achieved.

Palaoag","2024 IEEE 4th International Conference on Power, Electronics and Computer Applications (ICPECA)",2024,"In the evaluation of smart elderly care system, an innovative and accurate evaluation model can be built by combining Long short-term memory network (LSTM) and adaptive enhancement integrated algorithm AdaBoost. LSTM is a recursive neural network structure, which is especially suitable for processing time series data, and can effectively capture the data patterns that change over time in the process of elderly care service, such as the health status of the elderly, the changing trend of service demand, and the response effect of the system.In this scheme, LSTM network is first used to capture and learn the long-term dependence relationship and potential rules in the operation of the elderly care system, and through in-depth analysis of historical data, fine prediction and evaluation of the quality and effect of the elderly care service is formed. However, a single model may be limited by the risk of overfitting or underfitting, in which case the introduction of AdaBoost algorithm can significantly improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model. AdaBoost constructs and combines weak classifiers iteratively to create a strong classifier, which means tradeoff optimization among different evaluation indicators and improvement of overall evaluation performance for elderly care service evaluation. Taking LSTM as the basic learner within the framework of AdaBoost, the weight of LSTM can be adjusted according to the performance of LSTM in each iteration, so that the final integrated model can focus on those difficult cases and features with high discriminating power, so as to achieve more accurate and comprehensive evaluation results of pension system. In short, the combination of LSTM and AdaBoost in elderly care system evaluation not only makes full use of LSTM's powerful modeling ability for time series data, but also gives full play to AdaBoost's advantages in integrated learning, which helps to extract key evaluation indicators from diverse and complex elderly care service data thus providing more scientific and reliable support for optimizing the elderly care service system.",271421177,0,15,,

Employing a robust quantitative methodology, the study critically analyzes the data of 2425 firms from HTAS. The CFP and ESG scores data were collected from the Refinitiv Eikon (REE) database for 21 emerging Asian economies from 2019 to 2024. The study considers the independent variable ESG scores and the dependent variables Current Ratio (CR) and Net Profit Margin (NPM). To explore the relationship, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, robust pooled ordinary least square regression (POLS), random effect model (REM), fixed effect model (FEM), and robust REM were explored in detail. The study revealed that the ESG score has a ‐ve correlation with CR (−0.088**) and NPM (−0.055*). The empirical models show that no significant relationship exists between ESG score and CFP (CR; NPM) of HTAS in emerging Asian economies. The comparative analysis of models highlights that the robust REM is an effective and reliable model. The work contributes to the stakeholder theory and shows the relationship between ESG score and CFP, specifically CR and NPM.

To address these limitations, this study introduces a hybrid ESG risk assessment model that integrates court ruling data with traditional ESG ratings to detect latent sustainability risks. Using a dataset of 213 ESG-related U.S. court rulings from January 2023 to May 2025, we apply natural language processing (TF-IDF, Legal-BERT) and explainable AI (SHAP) techniques to extract structured features from legal texts. We construct and compare classification models—including Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Legal-BERT-based hybrid model—to predict firms’ litigation risk. The hybrid model significantly outperforms the baseline ESG-only model in all key metrics: F1-score (0.81), precision (0.79), recall (0.84), and AUC-ROC (0.87). SHAP analysis reveals that legal features such as regulatory sanctions and governance violations are the most influential predictors. This study demonstrates the empirical value of integrating adjudicated legal evidence into ESG modeling and offers a transparent, verifiable framework to enhance ESG risk evaluation and reduce information asymmetry in sustainability assessments.",290611518,0,52,,

Parvez Mahmud",Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies,2025,"Building refined artificial intelligence (AI) models on early warning systems (EWS) has revolutionary potential to forecast financial crises, identify unseen systemic risks, and enhance macroprudential supervision. In today's financial markets, where there are a lot of interconnections and volatility, minor signs of heading in the wrong financial direction can easily prove to be catastrophic unless quickly looked into. Conventional statistical instruments seem poorly bio-equipped to record such complex non-linear dynamics thus necessitating the dependency on intelligent data-driven solutions. The work utilises machine learning methods, Python based analytics and statistical modelling to aggregate macroeconomic indicators, market information and novel alternative datasets and turn them into a predictive framework capable of generating early warning signs of the beginning of systemic stress. The process implies intensive data cleaning, more sophisticated feature engineering, and supervised and unsupervised model training. Latent patterns of risk are revealed by utilizing correlation mapping and anomaly detection, which show increased predictive accuracy as compared to other traditional methods. The findings illustrate the abilities of the framework in increasing both timeliness and reliability of early warning, so the policymakers have more time to take preemptive actions. Tabular and graphical visualizations made in Python show a tendency towards risks over time, which is accurate and interpretable at the same time. This study focuses on ethical and practical aspects of the AI implementation in financial governance with the focus on the ways of the model transparency, bias elimination, and the explicability. In sum, the results show that AI-based EWS has the potential to transform macroprudential supervision with benefits of creating resilient financial systems in a new world of elevated uncertainty. The results of this study validated the reasoning that AI-enhanced early warning systems will revolutionize macroprudential oversight and will empower timely and evidence-based decision making.

Based on a survey of 2,000 public-sector employees, we identify five distinct adoption segments ranging from AI-Integrated Consumers (18.9%) who actively embrace both AI tools and traditional advisors, to Traditionalists (9.1%) who resist both technologies and professional advice. Contrary to expectations that AI adoption would reduce reliance on human advisors, our findings reveal a complementary relationship: employees with the highest AI adoption rates demonstrate 72% engagement with financial professionals compared to only 15% among technology-resistant segments. The analysis reveals that Employer-Driven AI Users (27.7%) represent a critical bridge segment, suggesting workplace-sponsored AI tools can facilitate adoption among employees who might otherwise resist independent AI exploration. Additionally, 40% of employees show low engagement with traditional financial professionals but varying degrees of openness to AI-assisted guidance, indicating significant potential for these tools to serve underserved populations. These findings challenge binary assumptions about AI versus human advice and provide actionable insights for plan sponsors implementing targeted, segment-specific strategies.

As GenAI tools become increasingly accessible and applied, their effects on entrepreneurial behavior and decisions are gaining attention. However, there is still not a clearly defined picture of the conceptual and empirical relationship between these two domains. To address this gap, a systematic review of literature has been conducted using PRISMA guidelines, across the databases of Scopus and Web of Science, collecting peer-reviewed articles between 2019 to 2025. Documents were identified, screened and evaluated, following criteria such as theoretical consistency and methodological relevance. In parallel, a science mapping approach was used, including co-occurrence of keywords, co-citation networks, and thematic clusters, with the goal to visualize the structure and growth of research. The results shows five main clusters: first, GenAI contributes to better performance by aligning well with entrepreneurial tasks; second, it enhances innovation and decision-making under uncertainty; third, it supports both generative and acquisitive learning in entrepreneurial contexts; fourth, it enables sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship by affecting how entrepreneurs perceive desirability and feasibility; and finally, GenAI plays a mediating role in product customization and market performance. Yet, there are challenges still to overcome ethical concerns, data bias and the lack of digital competencies among entrepreneurs. In conclusion, the paper recommends more studies that can go beyond correlation, including longitudinal designs or experimental methods, to better understand causal mechanisms.

We use an econometric toolkit: unit-root and cointegration testing, ARDL bounds, Toda–Yamamoto causality, and a two-state Markov Switching model to trace long-run equilibrium and transmission mechanisms across cryptocurrencies (BGCI), systemic stress (OFR-FSI), volatility measures (VIX, VVIX, VSTOXX, VVSTOXX, MOVE), major equities and bonds, and three commodities (gold, oil, copper). Results show robust long-run cointegration between BGCI and several financial variables, including S&amp;P/ASX 200 and the Bloomberg Barclays Bond Index; models that include commodities continue to support these long-term links. Toda–Yamamoto tests reveal that stress and volatility indices unidirectionally transmit shocks to cryptocurrencies and commodities, while gold displays a bidirectional relationship with BGCI, indicating a conditional safe haven interaction. Markov Switching estimates show amplified co-movement among BGCI, gold and bonds in stress regimes, with the model predominantly remaining in a normal state. Overall, cryptocurrencies are embedded within the broader financial system; commodities, especially gold, are used to moderate the stress crypto transmission and offer conditional diversification value during turmoil.",290991126,0,44,,

Using bidirectional encoder representations from transformer-based topic modeling (BERTopic), we processed Microsoft (MSFT) news and constructed monthly narrative activations (binary presence and decay weighting). These narrative activations are used in autoregressive moving-average models with exogenous regressors (ARIMA-X) to analyze MSFT monthly log returns alongside the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index from February 2021 to March 2025. Decay models using a similarity-distilled BERT embedding yielded three significant narratives: Media and Public Perception (MPP) (β = 0.0128, p = 0.002), Currency and Macro Environment (CME) (β = −0.0143, p &lt; 0.001), and Tech and Semiconductor Ecosystem (TSE) (β = −0.0606, p = 0.014). Binary activation identifies reputational shocks: the Media and Public Perception (MPP) indicator predicts lower returns at one- and two-month lags (β = −0.0758, p = 0.043; β = −0.1048, p = 0.007). A likelihood-ratio test comparing ARIMA-X models with narrative regressors to a baseline ARIMA (no narratives) rejects the null hypothesis that narratives add no improvement in fit (p &lt; 0.01). Firm-level narratives enhance monthly forecasts beyond conventional predictors; decay activation and similarity-distilled embeddings perform best.

The literature on AI in finance is growing, but there remains a notable absence regarding the impacts on small- and medium-sized financial services firms. We conduct a meta-analysis combining a systematic literature review, sentiment bibliometrics, and network analysis to examine how AI is transforming competition across different firm sizes in the financial sector. Our analysis of 160 publications reveals predominantly positive academic sentiment toward AI in finance (mean positive sentiment 0.725 versus negative 0.586, Cohen’s d = 0.790, p &lt; 0.0001), with anticipatory sentiment increasing significantly over time (β=2.10×10−2,p=0.007). However, network analysis reveals substantial conceptual fragmentation in the research discourse, with a low connectivity coefficient (ϕ=0.125) indicating that the field lacks unified terminology. These findings expose a critical knowledge gap: while scholars increasingly view AI as competitively advantageous, research has not coalesced around coherent models for understanding differential impacts across firm sizes. The absence of size-specific research leaves practitioners and policymakers without clear guidance on how AI adoption affects competitive positioning, particularly for smaller institutions that may face resource constraints or technological barriers.

10.59413/ajocs/v6.i5.12,Artificial Intelligence Technologies and Process Efficiency in the Banking Industry: A Case Study of Selected Commercial Banks in Kenya,"Annbel Nekoye Chibole, Bernard Ondara",African Journal of Commercial Studies,2025,"Banks are increasingly integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in their systems to streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and enhance transaction accuracy. While AI is expected to improve key process efficiency metrics, such as transaction turnaround time, decision-making speed, process error rate, and overall process cost, the actual impact on these specific performance indicators remains underexplored in Kenya's banking industry. Thus, this research examined the impact of AI technologies on process efficiency in selected commercial banks in Kenya. The study applied the technology acceptance model, resource-based view model, and the diffusion of innovation theory. The four independent variables: machine learning, robotic process automation, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, were analyzed in relation to process efficiency. The target population comprised of the 38 commercial banks in Kenya. The sampling frame was Equity Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Cooperative Bank, NCBA Bank, and Standard Chartered Bank branches in Nairobi County. The unit of analysis included the banks' branch managers and information technology managers, who were selected via purposive sampling. The sample size was 192 participants. Data was collected via closed-ended questionnaires, with a pilot study involving 19 participants to inform the questionnaire's reliability and validity pre-tests. SPSS version 22 was used for statistical analysis, and the findings presented in tables and charts. The researcher complied with appropriate ethical protocols. The findings showed that machine learning, robotic process automation, natural language processing, and predictive analytics impacted process efficiency in various magnitudes. All the four regression coefficients were statistically significant at p&lt;0.05. Robotic process automation had the most significant impact on process efficiency while predictive analytics had the least impact. The results of the correlation analysis showed a positive, strong and significant relationship between each of the four independent variables and process efficiency. The study concluded that AI technologies significantly impacted process efficiency in the selected commercial banks in Kenya. The findings underscore the need to incentivize investments in AI technologies in Kenya's banking sector. Future studies could explore associations underpinning other AI technologies and process efficiency indicators.",291271946,0,31,,

Drawing on recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism - such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified, particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.",291312329,0,41,,

Despite their rapid proliferation, the effects of ESG disclosure regulations remain contested. To provide a comprehensive assessment, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis and a meta‐analysis on previous studies. Following PRISMA guidelines, we selected 929 journal articles related to the impacts of ESG disclosure practices and regulations for a bibliometric analysis, and 32 studies with 411 effect sizes, quantifying the effects of ESG disclosure regulations for a meta‐analysis. Results indicate that the trend and spatial coverage of the publications align with the development of ESG disclosure practices. Second, the topic evolution reveals shifts from CSR reporting to ESG disclosure, from voluntary disclosure to strategic disclosure, and from qualitative to quantitative methods. Third, the meta‐analysis yields an average effect size of 0.06 for ESG disclosure regulations, confirming a modest but positive regulatory impact. Meta‐regression further shows that government‐issued mandates are less effective than exchange‐led rules, yet all regulations enhance corporate transparency and ESG performance. We recommend that future studies investigate the mechanisms of regulations, examine how they shape public perceptions, and delve into dynamics around stakeholder interaction.",291493867,0,55,,

This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of state programs supporting IDPs in terms of their alignment with the target group’s needs. The assessment was conducted based on data from a nationally representative sociological survey of IDPs. The analysis of the effectiveness of the housing assistance program for IDPs was conducted using elasticity coefficients that consider price growth and changes in the subsistence minimum. According to IDPs’ assessment, most programs funded from the state budget meet current needs and are rated above the average level, above 2.5 points out of 5. Programs of legal and informational support (3.8), cash assistance (4.3), access to medical care without restrictions (i.e., the requirement to sign a declaration) (3.4), provision of social housing (3.3), and tax deductions under rental agreements (3.2) are considered highly relevant. Low relevance was assigned to assistance with relocating businesses (1.7), grant support for starting a business (2.2), housing loans (2.2), and vocational training through referrals from the State Employment Service (2.4). Conclusions were drawn about the need for periodic monitoring of IDP needs and analyzing the effectiveness of funding while considering price changes and the subsidence minimum. This approach could be used to support decisions regarding the attraction of alternative sources of financing for social programs when state budget funding is insufficient to cover basic living needs of IDPs.

Using the Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) model, the study finds nuanced effects of board size on firm performance. Larger boards are positively associated with EPS, Tobin’s Q, and MVA, suggesting enhanced oversight and investor confidence. However, board expansion negatively affects ROA, and has no significant impact on shareholder return efficiency. These findings stress a central paradox: board enlargement contributes positively to capital market valuation but may simultaneously undermine asset utilisation and managerial responsiveness. The study advances the governance discourse by arguing for size agility in regulatory prescriptions and urging investors to critically evaluate board expansion beyond efficiency thresholds.

Ahmed, A. Abdelghani",Journal of Islamic Finance and Economic Studies,2025,"Background: Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 emphasizes economic diversification through Islamic finance and tourism, positioning halal investment funds as a strategic mechanism to channel ethical capital into sustainable tourism projects. Despite their growing prominence, the behavioral pathways through which fund attributes shape investment decisions remain insufficiently examined.
Aims: This study investigates how key attributes of halal investment funds—Sharīʿah compliance transparency, tourism project alignment, ESG integration, and profitability history—affect customer investment intentions. It further explores the mediating roles of customer trust and perceived developmental impact, and the moderating effect of religiosity among Islamic bank clients.
Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 clients of three leading Islamic banks in Riyadh during April–May 2025. Validated scales were employed, and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrapping (5,000 resamples) to test direct, indirect, and moderated mediation effects.
Result: The findings demonstrate that halal fund attributes significantly enhance investment intentions (β = 0.312, p < 0.001). Both customer trust (β = 0.198, p < 0.001) and perceived developmental impact (β = 0.156, p < 0.001) partially mediated this relationship. Religiosity acted as a significant moderator, strengthening these effects among highly religious clients. The model accounted for 62.3% of the variance in investment intentions, indicating substantial explanatory power.
Conclusion: Halal investment funds, when characterized by transparent Sharīʿah governance and demonstrable developmental contributions, can effectively mobilize Islamic capital for tourism under Vision 2030.

 This study aims to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on risk management practices within Palestinian banks, specifically examining its application in credit, market and operational risk domains. The research assesses the extent to which AI enhances risk mitigation effectiveness within the unique economic and regulatory context of Palestine.
 
 
 
 The study used an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. The initial quantitative phase involved surveying 80 internal auditors, selected via simple random sampling from a population of 95. This was followed by a qualitative phase comprising in-depth interviews with 23 purposively selected participants to contextualize and elaborate on the quantitative findings. Data were analyzed using statistical methods and deductive thematic analysis, guided theoretically by the DeLone and McLean (D&M) IS Success Model (2003).
 
 
 
 Findings demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in enhancing credit and operational risk management through improved decision-making accuracy, process automation and real-time anomaly detection. However, its potential contribution to market risk management is significantly constrained by infrastructural limitations, shortages in specialized expertise and competing strategic priorities, thereby underscoring the critical influence of contextual factors on successful AI adoption.
 
 
 
 The study acknowledges certain limitations. Primary reliance on internal auditors, while offering crucial oversight, may not capture the full experiential range; future work could benefit from including risk managers, IT specialists and senior management. The unique Palestinian politico-economic context necessarily limits direct generalizability, though identified themes regarding infrastructure, skills and strategy likely resonate with other emerging economies. Building on this study, future research should explore the longitudinal evolution of AI’s impact as infrastructure and skills develop. Comparative cross-country studies within diverse emerging markets would further elucidate national context influences. Integrating deeper analysis of organizational culture, change management and specific ethical considerations related to AI decision-making in risk management represents another fruitful avenue. Exploring the specific impact of different AI techniques (e.g. machine learning vs deep learning) across risk domains would also yield valuable insights. Such research will deepen the understanding of how AI can be effectively and responsibly leveraged to foster resilient global financial systems.
 
 
 
 The findings yield significant practical implications for stakeholders within the Palestinian banking sector and, by extension, for other emerging economies confronting similar challenges. First, AI’s differential impact underscores the imperative for banks to adopt a nuanced, risk-specific integration strategy. For credit and operational risks, where AI is effective, institutions should optimize existing systems and ensure robust governance frameworks upholding transparency, accountability and regulatory compliance. Second, identified infrastructural and human capital deficiencies, pivotal impediments in market risk management, necessitate strategic investment in data infrastructure (especially real-time capabilities) and specialized expertise through training, recruitment and partnerships. Third, regulatory bodies should consider developing adaptive governance frameworks, balancing innovation with financial stability and ethics. Incorporating standards like ISO/IEC 42001:2023, with flexibility for local contexts, can guide responsible AI adoption. Finally, a phased, context-sensitive implementation, aligned with continuous evaluation of system performance and organizational readiness, is advocated over wholesale adoption to enhance long-term success and resilience, empowering leaders to maximize AI’s potential within resource-constrained and volatile environments.
 
 
 
 This study advances understanding of AI in finance by providing empirical evidence on its differentiated impact across credit, market and operational risks within the Palestinian banking sector, a context marked by institutional and regulatory challenges. Theoretically, it extends the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model to AI-driven risk management. Practically, it offers actionable guidance on human capital, technological infrastructure and governance, fostering sustainable, context-sensitive AI-enabled risk management in emerging economies.

However, evidence regarding the impact of green accounting and leverage on firm value, particularly within Islamic capital markets, remains inconclusive. This study investigates how green accounting and leverage affect firm value, with financial performance acting as a mediating variable, among basic materials firms listed on the Indonesia Sharia Stock Index (ISSI).ObjectivesThis research aims to analyze the direct and indirect effects of green accounting and leverage on firm value through financial performance. It also seeks to determine whether sustainability-oriented accounting practices contribute to firm valuation and to evaluate the mediating role of profitability in shaping these relationships within an Islamic financial context.MethodA quantitative research design was employed using panel data from six basic materials firms listed on the ISSI during 2019–2023. Green accounting was measured using environmental cost disclosure, leverage by the debt-to-equity ratio, financial performance by return on assets, and firm value by Tobin’s Q. Data were analyzed using path analysis and the Random Effect Model, supported by classical assumption and Sobel tests to assess mediation effects.ResultsThe findings indicate that green accounting and leverage do not have significant direct effects on either financial performance or firm value. However, financial performance significantly mediates the relationship between green accounting and firm value, suggesting that sustainability initiatives enhance firm valuation indirectly through profitability. In contrast, financial performance does not mediate the relationship between leverage and firm value. These results demonstrate that environmental accountability contributes to firm value when translated into financial efficiency but not through debt-financed strategies.ImplicationsThis study highlights the need for firms to integrate environmental expenditures as strategic investments rather than operational costs. It underscores the importance of aligning sustainability initiatives with financial management and governance frameworks to optimize firm value. Policymakers should strengthen regulatory incentives for environmental reporting and enhance investor awareness to bridge the gap between sustainability performance and market valuation.Originality/NoveltyThis study contributes to sustainability accounting and Islamic finance literature by empirically establishing the mediating role of financial performance in the relationship between green accounting and firm value. It provides new insights into how environmentally responsible practices create value in emerging Islamic capital markets.",291991230,0,117,,

Khan, Mustafa Khan, Arsalan Mujahid Ghouri",Discover Sustainability,2025,"Abstract This study investigates the strategic importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices for enhancing firm financial performance (FFP) in developing economies, where sustainability efforts are often underprioritized. Amid the global push toward sustainability, emerging markets still lag in integrating ESG into corporate strategy due to weak enforcement, limited awareness, and short-term financial orientations. This study is therefore necessary to clarify whether and how ESG practices can yield financial benefits in such contexts, providing evidence-based insights for firms and policymakers seeking sustainable competitiveness. Motivated by the growing need to align corporate strategy with sustainability goals, this research examines how ESG practices influence financial outcomes directly, and indirectly through green innovation (GI). Grounded in the natural resource-based view (NRBV) theory, we address a specific gap by clarifying the mixed evidence on ESG’s financial effects in emerging markets and testing the mediating role of GI using firm-level data in emerging market context. We collected data using a structured questionnaire from respondents at non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the results demonstrate that all three ESG dimensions significantly and positively influence return on assets (ROA); however, the ESG dimensions have a significant negative effect on return on equity (ROE). Moreover, GI mediates the relationship between ESG and FFP. The findings highlight that ESG, often overlooked in emerging economies, can be strategically leveraged through GI to achieve better financial outcomes.

This study provides a broad analysis on the relationship between ESG, its components, and stock returns. Using a dataset that spans from December 2014 to December 2023, this research analyzes an annual average of around 2260 publicly traded companies from Europe and the United States. The findings consistently show a negative link between ESG ratings, their components, and stock returns, a result that is possibly explainable by the mixed effect of a reduction of risk (lower risk premium) from social responsibility, and lower profitability from associated costs. The coefficients for ESG and its pillars in explaining stock returns are generally consistent, with a few exceptions for the environmental and governance components. The environmental pillar has a stronger influence in Europe, across firm sizes, while in the US, the effect is limited to larger companies. For governance, variations align with differing ownership structures across regions and changing investor priorities as firms grow, with stronger influence in Midcaps of both regions and in U.S. Large Caps.

Alves, João Brunet",Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering,2025,"Ensuring that implemented code adheres to its intended architecture (architectural conformance) remains a critical challenge in software engineering. While formal verification tools exist, their use is hindered by the overhead of explicitly defining formal architectural specifications. At the same time, valuable architectural decisions and design constraints are often embedded in informal channels, such as pull request discussions and issue trackers, where they are expressed in natural language rather than formal specifications. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge this gap by investigating whether they can transform informal design rules, based on real development discussions on GitHub, into design tests — executable conformance checkers. Rather than relying on formal models, our approach focuses on deriving design tests from implicit architectural decisions discussed in natural language. To investigate this, we conducted a preliminary empirical study to generate 30 design tests representing rules for 6 design patterns. Our results show the potential of such a strategy, as 96.67% of the generated design tests execute successfully. Furthermore, 63.33% correctly assert expected behaviors, and 76.67% accurately reflect the intended architectural rules. This approach has the potential to simplify the conformance checking process by reducing the need to manually write formal specifications and tests.

Based on data encompassing Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2023, this paper investigates the effects of ESG rating divergence on corporate financial flexibility. We find that ESG rating divergence reduces corporate financial flexibility, and the finding remains reliable following various robustness tests. Mechanism tests show that ESG rating divergence diminishes corporate financial flexibility by raising operating leverage and the cost of equity capital, and exacerbating the degree of maturity mismatch between investing and financing. Further, we find that the negative impact of ESG rating divergence on financial flexibility is more pronounced in heavily polluting firms, enterprises with stronger market competitive positions, those facing lower financing constraints and companies with higher analyst earning forecast accuracies. We subsequently explore the economic effects of financial flexibility in reaction to ESG rating divergence. The findings indicate that ESG rating divergence negatively affects corporate sustainable resilience by first reducing financial flexibility.

Nguyen",Cogent Business &amp; Management,2025,"Abstract Recent years have seen rapid growth in research on climate-related disclosures, yet existing reviews mainly focus on carbon and GHG reporting through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), overlooking the broader framework introduced by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This study conducts a structured review of 134 peer-reviewed articles (2010–2025), all published in journals ranked 2* or higher according to the ABS 2024 Journal Guide, to integrate insights from both CDP and TCFD perspectives. The review makes three key contributions over past studies. First, it provides a structured and integrative synthesis to date by bridging CDP and TCFD based disclosure research, while prior reviews largely examined carbon disclosure in isolation. Second, it develops a thematic framework encompassing disclosure characteristics, quality and compliance, determinants, financial consequences and greenwashing, dimensions that earlier reviews treated separately. Finally, it advances the methodological rigor of prior reviews on climate related disclosures by applying a structured review and by identifying underexplored empirical gaps to guide future research. The findings offer actionable insights for regulators, investors and firms aiming to strengthen the quality, comparability and credibility of climate-related disclosures.",292248614,0,168,,

 The purpose of this research is to improve real estate market forecasting by introducing an innovative entropy-based multivariate clustering technique, Jensen–Shannon Time Series Segmentation (JSTS). The approach is designed to be integrated with advanced deep learning models such as Transformer, TSMixer, N-HiTS and LSTM, while incorporating key economic features such as consumer price index (CPI), sentiment analysis from headline news and real estate price and volume data to capture complex market dynamics.
 
 
 
 This study applies the JSTS clustering technique on a real dataset comprising Australian real estate market data, including property prices, volumes, CPI and sentiment scores derived from headline news. Advanced deep learning models such as Transformer, TSMixer, N-HiTS and LSTM are used for forecasting, and performance is compared against traditional clustering methods like weighted dynamic time warping (WDTW) and standalone forecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The models are evaluated based on forecasting accuracy metrics, including MAPE, RMSE and MASE.
 
 
 
 The experimental results show that the integration of JSTS clustering with advanced forecasting models significantly enhances the prediction accuracy compared to both traditional clustering methods and standalone forecasting models like ARIMA. The inclusion of sentiment from headline news further improves forecasting by providing real-time market sentiment insights, enabling the models to better capture market trends and behavioral shifts.
 
 
 
 While the proposed JSTS clustering method significantly improves forecasting accuracy, there are limitations in its computational complexity, especially when applied to large-scale, high-frequency datasets. The clustering process introduces additional computational overhead, which may require optimization for real-time applications. Further research is needed to explore the scalability of the JSTS approach across other domains such as stock markets or healthcare. Additionally, the model may require fine-tuning and domain expertise to adapt to varying market conditions, especially in different geographical regions.
 
 
 
 The integration of sentiment analysis from headline news with economic indicators such as price, volume and CPI in real estate forecasting provides actionable insights for investors, developers and policymakers. By improving prediction accuracy, the proposed framework can support better decision-making in the real estate sector, helping stakeholders to anticipate market trends, assess risks and optimize investments. This methodology can also be adapted for use in other financial markets or sectors where time series data and sentiment analysis are key factors.
 
 
 
 Accurate forecasting of real estate markets has significant social implications, as it influences housing affordability, urban development and financial stability. By improving prediction models, this research can contribute to more informed policies regarding housing, economic planning and real estate investments. Additionally, incorporating sentiment analysis reflects the impact of public opinion and economic sentiment on market dynamics, potentially offering better tools for understanding market behaviors during periods of social or economic instability, such as during pandemics or financial crises.
 
 
 
 This research presents a novel framework by combining JSTS clustering with state-of-the-art deep learning forecasting models and incorporating headline news sentiment into the prediction process. The method outperforms traditional approaches, offering a more accurate and robust solution for real estate time series forecasting, particularly in the volatile and complex Australian market. The integration of sentiment analysis into a multivariate framework is a key innovation, providing a deeper understanding of market behaviors.

This paper introduces a generalized version of the Modular Portfolio Learning System (MPLS), extending beyond its initial PPO backbone to integrate four RL algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). Building on its modular design, MPLS leverages specialized components for sentiment analysis, volatility forecasting, and structural dependency modeling, whose signals are fused within an attention-based decision framework. Unlike prior approaches, MPLS is evaluated independently on three major equity indices (S&P 500, DAX 30, and FTSE 100) across diverse regimes including stable, crisis, recovery, and sideways phases. Experimental results show that MPLS consistently achieved higher Sharpe ratios—typically +40–70% over Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) and Risk Parity (RP)—while limiting drawdowns and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) during stress periods such as the COVID-19 crash. Turnover levels remained moderate, confirming cost-awareness. Ablation and variance analyses highlight the distinct contribution of each module and the robustness of the framework. Overall, MPLS represents a modular, resilient, and practically relevant framework for risk-aware portfolio optimization.",292332165,0,40,,

The review aims to make the discussion accessible while maintaining academic rigor. The results demonstrate that while ESG reporting in developed economies has been strengthened by regulatory frameworks such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, developing countries continue to rely on voluntary and inconsistent disclosure practices. Quantitative evidence indicates a positive association between robust ESG disclosure and corporate outcomes such as profitability, market valuation, and stakeholder trust, though these effects vary across sectors and national contexts. However, significant obstacles persist, including fragmented regulatory approaches, data quality limitations, and misleading practices that erode investor confidence. The discussion highlights the influence of systemic factors such as governance structures, cultural norms, and investor activism, and suggests potential solutions through standardization, independent assurance, and participatory oversight. Future research directions are proposed to address gaps in developing countries and evaluate new regulatory frameworks. These findings reinforce the urgency of advancing ESG disclosure as a credible and impactful mechanism for achieving sustainable corporate transformation.",292389742,0,28,,

 This paper aims to analyze the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) components on the board of directors’ remuneration and the moderating effect of gender diversity on this impact.
 
 
 
 To achieve this aim, we have used panel data methodology on 337 Iberian-listed companies from 2013 to 2022, employing the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM).
 
 
 
 Our results suggest that companies with high ESG practices tend to adopt conservative policies regarding board members’ remuneration, and the sole effect of board diversity also works toward conservative compensation. Furthermore, gender diversity mitigates the negative impacts of environmental and social performance on remuneration but strengthens the negative impact of governance performance in this relationship.
 
 
 
 This study provides a novel perspective on the relationship between ESG performance and board member remuneration by introducing gender diversity as a moderating factor, an area still underexplored in the existing body of literature. Additionally, it uniquely contextualizes this analysis within Iberian-listed companies, emphasizing the regulatory impact of gender quotas and their implications on sustainable governance practices. Finally, by analyzing all three ESG pillars and incorporating gender diversity as a moderating variable, the study introduces a fresh perspective on sustainability initiatives and diverse leadership. This comprehensive approach advances the discussion on executive compensation and the role of ESG in promoting equitable and sustainable corporate governance practices.

Ruqnuzzaman, Kabir Uddin",(missing journal),2025,"<title>Abstract</title> The growth of the global gig economy has had a substantial impact on labor markets, especially in developing nations like Bangladesh. One of the major contributors to cross-border digital labor is Bangladesh. Freelancers still encounter difficulties, nevertheless, in obtaining safe, open, and effective international payment options. High transaction fees, settlement delays, currency fluctuations, and restricted access to global digital wallets all have an impact on financial inclusion and income security. Explainable AI (XAI) guarantees that AI-driven judgments are comprehensible, while blockchain facilitates safe and transparent transactions. When combined, these technologies could aid in resolving these issues.With an emphasis on blockchain, XAI, and dual-currency payment systems, this study systematically evaluates 124 peer-reviewed publications that were released between 2015 and 2024. The research were divided into four sections based on PRISMA 2020 guidelines: blockchain-based cross-border payments, XAI applications in banking, dual-currency frameworks (including cryptocurrencies, CBDCs, and DeFi), and freelancing in underdeveloped countries. The findings show that XAI increases transparency in automated financial decision-making, dual-currency systems offer resilience against currency volatility, and blockchain lowers transaction costs and settlement times. When combined, these technologies provide freelancers with increased trust, quicker payments, and smooth communication with local mobile financial services (MFS) like bKash and Nagad.Despite these benefits, low digital literacy, unclear regulations, and limited infrastructure impede adoption.

However, its impacts are upon environment too, which can be both positive and negative. Against this backdrop, the study explores empirically the pair-wise long-term equilibrium relationships and short-term dynamics between AI and labour productivity, AI and gross domestic product (GDP), and AI and CO2 emissions over the period from 2012 to 2023, focusing on a panel of the top 20 AI-investing countries. Initially, the analysis using correlation coefficients reveals that most countries show a positive relationship between AI and labour productivity, as well as AI and GDP. Conversely, there was a negative relationship between AI and CO2 emissions in these countries. For more robust conclusions, the study has employed panel data econometric methods. The Westerlund cointegration test results indicate that long-term stable relationships exist between AI, labour productivity, GDP, and CO2 emissions in the selected countries. Furthermore, the PMG-ARDL model reveals that AI does not have impacts upon labour productivity, GDP, and CO2 emissions in the short run. However, in the long run, AI significantly boosts labour productivity and GDP, while not contributing to CO2 emissions. The negative and significant coefficients of the Error Correction Term (ECT) suggest that short-term deviations are corrected over time, reinforcing the long-term positive relationship.

The main issues examined are how ESG reporting is implemented and the extent of its influence on firm value, as well as which ESG component has the most significant impact. The research method employs a quantitative approach with a causal comparative design, utilizing secondary data sourced from annual reports, sustainability reports, and market data over five years. Firm value is proxied using Tobin's Q ratio, while the level of ESG disclosure is measured based on the GRI Standards framework. Data analysis techniques use multiple linear regression by incorporating control variables including firm size, profitability (ROA), and leverage to enhance result validity. The research findings indicate that ESG reporting has a positive and significant effect on firm value with a coefficient of β = 0.018 and p < 0.001, with a model predictive capability (R²) of 87.3%. Indofood's ESG Score experienced substantial improvement from 56.3% in 2020 to 78.9% in 2024, accompanied by an increase in Tobin's Q from 0.982 to 1.523. Component-wise analysis reveals that the Social aspect provides the highest impact (β = 0.009), followed by Governance (β = 0.007) and Environmental (β = 0.006).

 Efficiency‐led sustainability is important but often fails to deliver absolute reductions in resource use, leaving organisations exposed to rebound effects. What remains underexplored is how sufficiency, the strategic limitation of consumption and resource use, is operationalised within organisational contexts. We address this gap through a systematic review of 70 peer‐reviewed studies, using the Structure‐Conduct‐Performance (SCP) framework to connect enabling conditions, organisational practices and sustainability performance. We identify eight thematic clusters reflecting how sufficiency is enacted across domains such as governance and policy, organisational practices, social norms and infrastructural systems. Building on these, we develop a typology of five strategic types through which organisations operationalise sufficiency. This paper (1) adds a system‐level perspective that bridges structural, strategic and performance domains; (2) extends the SCP framework as a theory‐building lens to expose misalignments that hinder sufficiency transitions; and (3) highlights tensions that challenge dominant assumptions in sustainability‐oriented organisational strategy.",293011264,0,127,,

It addresses the core problem of financial text analysis and credit risk assessment by proposing a hybrid model that combines the generative semantic understanding of Generative Pre-trained Transformer-4 (GPT-4) with the enhanced feature extraction of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). To overcome the limitations of traditional methods—such as weak contextual reasoning in long texts, insufficient recognition of industry-specific terminology, and implicit credit risk expressions—the model incorporates a financial dictionary enhancement module and a named entity recognition (NER) component. GPT-4 is leveraged for prompt-based generation to extract latent risk information from complex texts, including annual reports. A dual-model semantic fusion mechanism with attention weighting constructs a multi-level risk assessment system that integrates contextual understanding, industry adaptability, and interpretability. Experiments on multiple publicly available financial datasets and real-world annual reports demonstrate the model’s effectiveness. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms representative baseline models in accuracy, adaptability, and interpretability.

The purpose of this study is to develop a scale that measures students’ attitudes towards AI-based scoring systems in education and to test the validity and reliability of this scale. In the study, a literature review was conducted and expert opinion was consulted to develop the scale items. The first form of the scale was administered to 416 participants. The construct validity of the scale was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and rotation procedures. As a result of these procedures, a structure consisting of 12 items and two main factors (AI-SAS positive attitude and AI-SAS negative attitude) was determined. In the next step, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out on the data obtained from 441 participants. The results showed that the scale has robust construct validity. To test concurrent validity, comparisons with the General Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) and the AI Anxiety Scale (AI Anxiety) revealed significant relationships between the AI-SAS and these scales. In addition, measurement invariance was tested to ensure that the scale would measure consistently across different demographic groups. The results showed that the AI-SAS scale has a similar factor structure in different groups according to demographic variables such as gender, type of school, use of artificial intelligence in daily life, and can therefore be used in different subgroups. In conclusion, this study provides a reliable and valid scale to measure students’ attitudes towards AI-based scoring systems in education.

This research employs a sample of LQ45 listed companies in Indonesia from 2020 to 2023, generating 100 panel data units from 25 companies, which were analyzed using random-effects GLS regression. Documentation was used for data collection. The results indicate that ESG ratings do not provide significant evidence of influencing firm performance as measured by return on assets, return on equity, and earnings per share. The presence of a board of directors with several meetings can negatively affect firm performance. A notable finding of this study is the positive and significant impact of the female board of commissioners' composition on the firm's performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity. The proportion of female board members also significantly impacts ESG ratings. However, only company size can significantly affect EPS. This study suggests that a female board of commissioners has a positive impact on firm performance and ESG ratings.

Yiğit",Entropy,2025,"Sustainable finance exhibits non-linear dynamics, regime shifts, and distributional drift that challenge conventional forecasting, particularly in volatile emerging markets. Conventional models, which often overlook this structural complexity, can struggle to produce stable or reliable probabilistic forecasts. To address this challenge, this study introduces a complexity-aware forecasting framework that operationalizes information-theoretic meta features, Shannon entropy (SE), permutation entropy (PE) and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence to make Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) index forecasting more stable, probabilistically accurate, and operationally reliable. Applied in an emerging-market setting using Türkiye’s ESG index as a natural stress test, the framework was benchmarked against a macro-technical baseline with a calibrated XGBoost classifier under a strictly chronological, leakage-controlled nested cross-validation protocol and evaluated on a strictly held-out test set. In development, the framework achieved statistically significant improvements in both stability and calibration, reducing fold-level dispersion (by 40.4–66.6%) across all metrics and enhancing probability-level alignment with Brier score reduced by 0.0140 and the ECE by 0.0287. Furthermore, a meta-analytic McNemar’s test confirmed a significant reduction in misclassifications across the development folds. On the strictly held-out test set, the framework’s superiority was confirmed by a statistically significant reduction in classification errors (exact McNemar p < 0.001), alongside strong gains in imbalance-robust metrics such as BAcc (0.618, +12.8%) and the MCC (0.288, +38.5%), achieving an F1-score of 0.719. Overall, the findings of the complexity-aware framework indicate that explicitly representing the market’s informational state and transitions yields more stable, well-calibrated, and operationally reliable forecasts in regime-shifting financial environments, supporting enhanced robustness and practical deployability.",293146432,0,114,,

This study presents the design and development process of an LLM‐powered educational platform prototype and its evaluation in a single learning session on the Computer Networks and Telecommunications course at a technical faculty specialized in information systems and technologies. The proposed platform combines a microlearning paradigm and the availability of LLM chatbot support after each learning unit for students to clarify misconceptions and deepen knowledge and comprehension. The prototype was built using Angular for the client‐side application and Express.js for the backend with Firebase Firestore as the database solution. It leveraged the OPENAI GPT‐4o model through the available Application Programming Interface (API) for providing the chatbot, which was instructed to offer support for students in the context of the mentioned course. As a result, students generally found the chatbot to be a useful support tool in the learning process, with higher effectiveness reported for clarifying theoretical concepts compared to assisting with practical tasks. This perception aligns with expert evaluations of the chatbot's responses, which revealed statistically significant differences between theoretical and practical answers in terms of factual accuracy, relevance, completeness, and coherence, but not in fluency. Despite these observed differences, both student and expert assessments were overall positive across both types of questions. Even though single‐session evaluation limits generalizability of results, these findings suggest feasibility and promising results within this educational context since the chatbot is perceived as a valuable component of the learning experience.",293373202,0,58,,

10.1002/cae.70105,Educational Platform in Higher Education With LLM-Driven Chatbot for Computer Networks and Telecommunications Course,Ivan Milenković,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2025,"ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs) brought the possibility of enhancing chatbot interactions in educational platforms by providing students adapted support throughout the learning process. This study presents the design and development process of an LLM‐powered educational platform prototype and its evaluation in a single learning session on the Computer Networks and Telecommunications course at a technical faculty specialized in information systems and technologies. The proposed platform combines a microlearning paradigm and the availability of LLM chatbot support after each learning unit for students to clarify misconceptions and deepen knowledge and comprehension. The prototype was built using Angular for the client‐side application and Express.js for the backend with Firebase Firestore as the database solution. It leveraged the OPENAI GPT‐4o model through the available Application Programming Interface (API) for providing the chatbot, which was instructed to offer support for students in the context of the mentioned course. As a result, students generally found the chatbot to be a useful support tool in the learning process, with higher effectiveness reported for clarifying theoretical concepts compared to assisting with practical tasks. This perception aligns with expert evaluations of the chatbot's responses, which revealed statistically significant differences between theoretical and practical answers in terms of factual accuracy, relevance, completeness, and coherence, but not in fluency. Despite these observed differences, both student and expert assessments were overall positive across both types of questions. Even though single‐session evaluation limits generalizability of results, these findings suggest feasibility and promising results within this educational context since the chatbot is perceived as a valuable component of the learning experience.",293534316,0,58,,

Design drawings of support structures collected from authoritative design institutes were semantically processed and expanded through a structural knowledge‐guided augmentation (SKGA) approach. The SupportGAN model was then trained with multiple hyperparameter configurations to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, SupportGAN was evaluated and compared with two mainstream GAN models (pix2pix and pix2pixHD), demonstrating its superior capabilities. The design results generated by SupportGAN were evaluated using visual assessment and quantitative metrics. A feasibility assessment was also performed to confirm the economic and mechanical viability of the generated layouts: A pixel‐count proxy showed a 6.90% material gap versus engineer designs, and results of the finite element (FE) analysis on two cases indicated comparable structural performance (force difference ). The results indicate that SupportGAN's outputs exhibit significant similarities to those of expert engineers across various aspects, demonstrating its potential to aid designers in the preliminary conceptual layout design of corner‐ and cross‐supporting structures.",293557236,0,39,,

Grounded in Signalling Theory and Stakeholder Salience Theory, this study examines how ESG ratings, disclosure types (voluntary versus mandatory), and pillar salience shape the behavioural responses of SMMEs. Using a mixed‐methods design, the research combines three between‐subjects vignette experiments with a qualitative enquiry. Data were drawn from South African SMME decision‐makers across a field sample (Study 1: n = 101), two independent national online panels (Study 2: n = 200 and Study 3: n = 175), and 17 semi‐structured interviews (Study 4). Findings indicate that higher third‐party ESG ratings significantly enhance SMMEs' positive responses to offers from larger firms. The social pillar consistently emerged as the most influential, reflecting South Africa's inequality and collective welfare priorities, while governance also mattered in compliance‐sensitive industries. By contrast, the type of disclosure (mandatory vs. voluntary) had no measurable impact on SMME responses. Theoretically, this paper links ESG practices to stakeholders' judgments of legitimacy and urgency, clarifying the conditions under which ESG cues translate into cooperative intent. In practice, the paper shows how large firms can better calibrate ESG communication and investment to attract SMME partners in B2B markets.",294013458,0,42,,

It aims to understand how these connections contribute to environmental sustainability through effective management of green investments, particularly during periods of market turbulence. Design/methodology/approach The study uses time-varying parameters vector auto regressions (TVP-VAR) approach based on generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GEVD). This methodology captures the evolving nature of return spillovers and interconnectedness between the assets studied, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The findings suggest that the connectedness among the assets vary over time with a notable heave during the pandemic and a decline during the 2015–2016 oil crisis. Shariah-compliant assets, green bonds and clean energy investments, and are identified as net recipients of shocks, whereas gold, Islamic stocks and sustainable investments act as net transmitters of shocks. This distinction in asset behavior highlights their relatively low level of connectedness throughout the time-varying patterns. Practical implications The findings highlight the importance of understanding dynamic return spillovers and connectedness for investors and policymakers. By recognizing patterns such as net pairwise connectedness between various asset pairs, they can develop strategies to improve portfolio diversification and hedging.

A single-case study was conducted on Rural Bank, PT BPR “C”, while primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews, and company documents. Risks were identified, analyzed, evaluated, and addressed in accordance with ISO 31000 principles, while ESG factors were embedded in the strategic mapping of BSC perspectives. The results reveal that environmental risks exert the most significant impact on financial outcomes, notably influencing key indicators such as Non-Performing Loan (NPL), Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), and Return on Assets (ROA). They highlight the urgent need for proactive risk mitigation strategies. By mapping risks to strategic objectives, the institution improves transparency, resilience, and alignment between risk management and performance measurement. The findings support extending the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Stakeholder theory, demonstrating that internal capabilities and stakeholder-focused governance can serve as critical drivers of competitive advantage and long-term value creation. The research offers practical contributions by presenting a replicable model for rural banks seeking to integrate ESG risk management into their operational and strategic frameworks.

Sykulski",Scientific Reports,2025,"Abstract Capturing nonlinear relationships while maintaining interpretability remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise, a stepwise regression framework that adaptively transforms numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision trees—only when such transformations improve model fit according to the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion. This design preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly capturing threshold-based nonlinear effects, positioning SplitWise between classical linear and interpretable nonlinear regression. SplitWise retains a single, globally linear equation that selectively incorporates data-driven thresholds—yielding models that remain straightforward to interpret and verify. Across synthetic scenarios with nonlinear signal patterns, SplitWise reduced median RMSE by 7–14% relative to the best-performing interpretable linear baseline and improved variable-selection accuracy (median Matthews Correlation Coefficient up to $$\sim$$ 0.79 vs. $$\sim$$ 0.51 for LASSO). On real datasets, SplitWise matched or slightly improved RMSE while selecting fewer predictors. For instance, on Wine Quality (White), it improved RMSE from 0.756 to 0.752 and on Wine Quality (Red) from 0.654 to 0.649, using 6–10 predictors.

Employing fixed effects, the generalised method of moments, and instrumental variable models, we find that stronger ESG performance is significantly associated with lower credit risk, as measured by the distance to default. Mediation analysis reveals that this relationship operates primarily through enhanced profitability and improved external governance. In contrast, Tobin's Q acts as a negative channel, potentially reflecting market overvaluation and inefficiencies. ESG's impact also varies across firm types: the risk‐reducing effect is most pronounced among non‐state‐owned enterprises (NSOEs), firms based in eastern provinces, and those in the growth or decline stage of the corporate lifecycle. Further analysis shows that environmental (E) and social (S) pillars drive credit improvements, whereas the governance (G) score has an insignificant effect.

A sample of fifty professionals from finance, accounting, and corporate governance, representing diverse organizations, participated in the research. Data collection employed a structured questionnaire covering six domains: financial leadership and governance effectiveness; AI adoption and integration; AI-driven leadership transformation; AI in strategic financial planning; AI and ethical or regulatory compliance; and organizational context. Each domain was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Reliability analysis demonstrated strong internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values exceeding 0.70. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlations, and multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate relationships among variables. The results show that AI-driven leadership transformation and AI in strategic financial planning are significant positive predictors of financial leadership effectiveness, highlighting their relevance to governance outcomes. Conversely, AI adoption and integration, ethical or regulatory compliance, and organizational context did not exhibit significant direct effects. The regression model exhibited moderate explanatory power (R = .545, R² = .297, Adjusted R² = .217; F = 3.718, p = .007), indicating that AI-related factors explain a substantial, though incomplete, proportion of the variance in financial leadership effectiveness. The findings indicate that leveraging AI in leadership and strategic planning is essential for enhancing financial governance, whereas adoption, compliance, and context may function as enabling factors rather than direct determinants. These results advance the discourse on AI’s role in financial management and underscore the importance of leadership-oriented AI strategies for improving governance effectiveness.</italic>",294072435,0,7,,

AI applications span investment management, risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service, with predictive analytics and automation driving measurable improvements. For instance, AI-powered pattern recognition strengthens investment decisions, while advanced risk models enable more accurate detection of loan defaults and credit risks. Similarly, AI chat-bots and virtual assistants provide round-the-clock customer support, significantly improving user experience. Despite these opportunities, the adoption of AI in finance presents pressing challenges.

However, the dependence on the network environment has brought about many hidden dangers such as network information interference and privacy data protection. To practice the concept of ``teaching students according to their aptitude"" put forward by educators in the classical Chinese era, we have designed a series of software CLAP (Chat Local and Persistent) based on AIGC technology and using large language models. On the other hand, the software can also help learners transfer their own conversational context, allowing them to ``personalize learning"" according to their situation. Of course, this software is still in the early stages of development, and its current functions are limited to scenarios based on generalized language learning, including programming language learning and foreign language learning.

Sykulski",Scientific Reports,2025,"Abstract Capturing nonlinear relationships while maintaining interpretability remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise, a stepwise regression framework that adaptively transforms numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision trees—only when such transformations improve model fit according to the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion. This design preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly capturing threshold-based nonlinear effects, positioning SplitWise between classical linear and interpretable nonlinear regression. SplitWise retains a single, globally linear equation that selectively incorporates data-driven thresholds—yielding models that remain straightforward to interpret and verify. Across synthetic scenarios with nonlinear signal patterns, SplitWise reduced median RMSE by 7–14% relative to the best-performing interpretable linear baseline and improved variable-selection accuracy (median Matthews Correlation Coefficient up to $$\sim$$ 0.79 vs. $$\sim$$ 0.51 for LASSO). On real datasets, SplitWise matched or slightly improved RMSE while selecting fewer predictors. For instance, on Wine Quality (White), it improved RMSE from 0.756 to 0.752 and on Wine Quality (Red) from 0.654 to 0.649, using 6–10 predictors. On Bodyfat, it achieved 3.48–3.49 RMSE with four predictors, comparable to Elastic Net (3.41–3.48 RMSE) but with smaller models.",294123152,0,47,,

A sample of fifty professionals from finance, accounting, and corporate governance, representing diverse organizations, participated in the research. Data collection employed a structured questionnaire covering six domains: financial leadership and governance effectiveness; AI adoption and integration; AI-driven leadership transformation; AI in strategic financial planning; AI and ethical or regulatory compliance; and organizational context. Each domain was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Reliability analysis demonstrated strong internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values exceeding 0.70. Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlations, and multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate relationships among variables. The results show that AI-driven leadership transformation and AI in strategic financial planning are significant positive predictors of financial leadership effectiveness, highlighting their relevance to governance outcomes. Conversely, AI adoption and integration, ethical or regulatory compliance, and organizational context did not exhibit significant direct effects. The regression model exhibited moderate explanatory power (R = .545, R² = .297, Adjusted R² = .217; F = 3.718, p = .007), indicating that AI-related factors explain a substantial, though incomplete, proportion of the variance in financial leadership effectiveness. The findings indicate that leveraging AI in leadership and strategic planning is essential for enhancing financial governance, whereas adoption, compliance, and context may function as enabling factors rather than direct determinants. These results advance the discourse on AI’s role in financial management and underscore the importance of leadership-oriented AI strategies for improving governance effectiveness.</italic>",294123240,0,7,,

In our analysis, we examine six models: k ‐nearest neighbors, random forest, decision tree, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector machines regressors. We find that XGBoost, random forest, and extra trees regressors exhibit the highest predictive power with the lowest error. Decision tree feature importance analyses identify firm size, CEO age, tangibility, cash holding, and Tobin's Q as key factors in predicting CEO compensation. We also conduct ordinary least squares regressions and find that the significance levels of the coefficients are comparable to the feature importances from the machine learning analysis. Our feature‐grouping analysis shows that firms' financial performance and economic characteristics play the most significant role in determining CEO compensation, followed by board characteristics. The analysis further indicates that the predictive power of random forest and extra trees is stronger for forecasting next year's compensation than for predicting the current year's. These findings are valuable for compensation consultants and stakeholders involved in benchmarking decisions.",294133636,0,61,,

Using ESG Score data from the Refinitiv database, this study analyzes 232 firm-year observations from 2018 to 2023. SPCR is measured using Negative Skewness (NSKEWNESS), an indicator capturing the asymmetry of return distributions that reflects the buildup of hidden bad news and Down-to-Up Volatility (DUVOL), which captures downside volatility relative to upside movements. Regression results show that the aggregate ESG Score significantly reduces SPCR when measured with NSKEWNESS, indicating that firms with stronger ESG engagement are less likely to experience extreme negative price declines. When decomposed, the Environmental and Social components significantly mitigate SPCR, while Governance exhibits a negative but insignificant effect. However, none of the ESG components significantly influence DUVOL, suggesting that ESG practices may be more effective in addressing long-term crash risk rather than short-term price volatility.

 Practices of Large Firms: A Multidimensional Perspective in the
 B2B
 Context",Paul Blaise Issock Issock,Business Strategy &amp; Development,2025,"
 
 Prior research on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices has primarily focused on how they affect large firms' financial performance and investor responses, leaving a limited understanding of how key stakeholders, such as small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs), respond to the ESG practices of larger firms. Grounded in Signalling Theory and Stakeholder Salience Theory, this study examines how ESG ratings, disclosure types (voluntary versus mandatory), and pillar salience shape the behavioural responses of SMMEs. Using a mixed‐methods design, the research combines three between‐subjects vignette experiments with a qualitative enquiry. Data were drawn from South African SMME decision‐makers across a field sample (Study 1:
 n
  = 101), two independent national online panels (Study 2:
 n
  = 200 and Study 3:
 n
  = 175), and 17 semi‐structured interviews (Study 4). Findings indicate that higher third‐party ESG ratings significantly enhance SMMEs' positive responses to offers from larger firms. The social pillar consistently emerged as the most influential, reflecting South Africa's inequality and collective welfare priorities, while governance also mattered in compliance‐sensitive industries. By contrast, the type of disclosure (mandatory vs. voluntary) had no measurable impact on SMME responses. Theoretically, this paper links ESG practices to stakeholders' judgments of legitimacy and urgency, clarifying the conditions under which ESG cues translate into cooperative intent. In practice, the paper shows how large firms can better calibrate ESG communication and investment to attract SMME partners in B2B markets.

 In response to growing calls for ethical, sustainable, and digitally enabled supply chains, this study investigates how the responsible deployment of generative AI (GenAI) enhances circular supply chain performance (CSP). Anchored in ethical theory, the dynamic capability view (DCV), and conservation of resources (COR) theory, we develop a multitheoretic framework examining how firms' digital humanism orientation and procurement innovation mindset shape responsible GenAI use. We further theorize how this responsible GenAI use activates AI‐augmented supplier development for circularity (AISD) as a dynamic capability, which mediates the relationship between responsible GenAI use and CSP. Contextual stressors, specifically, polycrisis experience and precarious behavior among supply chain professionals, are introduced as moderators that may undermine these relationships. The model is tested using time‐lagged survey data from firms in India and South Africa, analyzed via covariance‐based structural equation modeling. Findings support all proposed relationships across both country contexts. The study contributes by (1) extending ethical theory into GenAI‐enabled circular supply chains, (2) conceptualizing responsible GenAI use and AISD as firm‐level second‐order and first‐order dynamic capabilities that enhance sustainability outcomes, and (3) revealing how crisis‐driven human behavior conditions the efficacy of responsible GenAI in complex supply chain environments.

This study examines the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate operator expertise based on subjective textual responses gathered during a defect analysis task. Operators were asked to describe screen defects using open-ended questions, and their responses were compared with expert responses to evaluate their accuracy and consistency. We employed four NLP models, including finetuned Sentence-BERT (SBERT), pre-trained SBERT, Word2Vec, and Dice similarity, to determine their effectiveness in interpreting short, domain-specific text. A novel disagreement tagging framework was introduced to supplement traditional similarity metrics with explainable insights. This framework identifies the root causes of model–human misalignment across four categories: defect type, severity, terminology, and location. Results show that a finetuned SBERT model significantly outperforms other models by achieving Pearsons’s correlation of 0.93 with MAE and RMSE scores of 0.07 and 0.12, respectively, providing more accurate and context-aware evaluations. In contrast, other models exhibit limitations in semantic understanding and consistency. The results highlight the importance of finetuning NLP models for domain-specific applications and demonstrate how qualitative tagging methods can enhance interpretability and model debugging.

 Performance and Credit Risk: Evidence From Chinese Manufacturing Companies","Yanan Wang, Xiao Zhang, Michal Wojewodzki, Yuxin Jian, Fadey AbiDaoud",International Journal of Finance &amp; Economics,2025,"
 This study investigates the effect of corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on credit risk using a sample of manufacturing firms listed on China's Shanghai and Shenzhen A‐share markets from 2009 to 2021. Employing fixed effects, the generalised method of moments, and instrumental variable models, we find that stronger ESG performance is significantly associated with lower credit risk, as measured by the distance to default. Mediation analysis reveals that this relationship operates primarily through enhanced profitability and improved external governance. In contrast, Tobin's Q acts as a negative channel, potentially reflecting market overvaluation and inefficiencies. ESG's impact also varies across firm types: the risk‐reducing effect is most pronounced among non‐state‐owned enterprises (NSOEs), firms based in eastern provinces, and those in the growth or decline stage of the corporate lifecycle. Further analysis shows that environmental (E) and social (S) pillars drive credit improvements, whereas the governance (G) score has an insignificant effect. Our findings provide theoretical and empirical insights into the ESG–credit risk nexus, highlighting the importance of sector‐specific, regionally sensitive ESG strategies in emerging markets.",294462058,0,77,,

Drawing on the resource-based view, legitimacy theory, and agency theory, this study examines both direct and indirect mechanisms connecting corporate profitability, firm size, and ownership concentration to enhance ESG performance. This research employs secondary panel data from the CSMAR, DIB, and WIND databases (13,911 observations) and estimates two-way fixed effects models with firm-clustered standard errors. The outcomes show that profitability, firm size, and ESG performance have positive relationships, but ownership concentration is a negative factor in ESG performance. Market share and managers’ risk preferences mediate the relationship between firm characteristics and ESG performance; however, these effects are interpreted as exploratory due to panel data constraints. Internal control enhances these relationships, which emphasize the importance of the process of sustainability itself. The study provides practical insights that managers, policymakers, or investment firms can apply to improve ESG integration accountability in the emerging markets context.",294485370,0,110,,

However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.",294591316,0,25,,

In this context, the systematic risk component (CAPM's beta) emerges as a critical factor that needs to be deeply analyzed, taking into account ESG. Since the relationship between ESG and the systematic risk is largely controversial, this study aims to explore this latter by also considering the moderating role played by two types of internal controls: the audit committee independence and the ESG‐related executive compensation. To reach the target, an analysis on a sample of 200 non‐financial European listed companies observed from 2015 to 2023 has been performed with a fixed effects estimator and random forest. Findings reveal an inverted U‐shaped relationship between ESG score and beta as well as a moderating role played by the internal controls, providing several theoretical and practical contributions.",294634714,0,44,,

To forecast ISE 100 index the monthly closing prices for seven macro-economic indicators (Money Supply (M2), Producer Price Index (PPI), Industrial Production Index (IPI), Exchange Rate (USD/TRY), Bond Interest Rates, Brent Oil Prices, and Gold Prices) are used in January 2001 to January 2022. The ISE 100 index has been forecasted within the framework of both deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Logit and Probit models, and the forecast performances of these methods have been compared. Analysis results reveal that the effects of selected macroeconomic variables on the ISE 100 index intensify during crisis periods, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the global financial crisis of 2008. In addition, the changes in the real sector have a significant impact on the capital sector, and the deep learning model is more successful in predicting financial crises. The results of the analysis show that the LSTM deep learning architectures, developed to analyze the effects of macroeconomic indicators on the ISE 100 index, have a very low error level and give more effective and satisfactory results than Logit-Probit regression models.

The Impact of Listed Companies' Generative AI Disclosure on ESG Rating Divergence: A Signaling Theory Perspective,"Kan Wu, Y Chen, Weicheng Xiao, Jerry C. Hu",(missing journal),2025,"<title>Abstract</title> Publicly listed companies are increasingly disclosing information related to generative artificial intelligence (GAI), yet it remains unclear how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies—as key information intermediaries—interpret these complex signals. This study extends signaling theory to examine the effect of corporate GAI disclosures on ESG rating divergence, highlighting that the impact depends on the interaction between signal complexity and signal credibility. Using textual analysis of annual reports from listed firms and combining these with ESG ratings from multiple mainstream agencies, we conduct an empirical investigation. The results show that: (1) low-complexity disclosures, such as merely mentioning GAI concepts or products, have no significant effect on rating divergence; (2) disclosures describing concrete applications and use cases of GAI effectively reduce information asymmetry and thus significantly converge rating divergence; (3) high-complexity disclosures, such as claims of possessing underlying technologies, without sufficient credibility support, increase interpretive difficulty and thereby amplify rating divergence in an inverted U-shaped pattern; and (4) firms' ownership of AI-related patents, serving as a key credibility signal, can substantially mitigate the negative effects of high-complexity disclosures. This study reveals the mechanisms through which emerging technology disclosures shape ESG rating divergence, offering a novel explanatory dimension for understanding its sources, and providing important practical implications for corporate disclosure strategies and market regulation.",294930228,0,64,,

Design/methodology/approach A three-stage process was used to analyze a dataset of 1,267 companies from knowledge-intensive industries. In the first stage, principal component analysis was applied to identify the types of ESG-related activities. Next, using cluster analysis, we identified patterns or modes of ESG-related behavior. Third, the identified clusters were compared in terms of their innovation-related behavior. Findings Compared to companies that demonstrated low ESG engagement, enterprises that have adopted comprehensive ESG strategies were found to be more likely to foster innovation and thus achieve sustainable competitive advantages. Our results highlight the particular importance of relational capital in stakeholder collaboration and knowledge sharing. Research limitations/implications While measuring ESG and innovation at the corporate level presents inherent challenges, this study contributes positively by offering a structured categorization of ESG modes, enabling more precise and meaningful comparisons. Our framework reduces ambiguity in assessing ESG-innovation dynamics and provides a solid foundation for future research. Moreover, the study opens exciting avenues for exploration, such as investigating the causal relationship between ESG engagement and innovation outcomes. Future research can build on these insights to examine how specific ESG models drive distinct innovation characteristics, particularly in developing economies and among SMEs, thereby enriching the global understanding of sustainable corporate strategies. Practical implications The study’s findings provide actionable insights for companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders on strategically integrating ESG and innovation. Businesses can leverage these insights to better align their ESG and innovation strategies, recognizing the critical role of relational and structural capital. Fragmented ESG communication yields limited value compared to cohesive strategies that foster external collaboration. Policymakers, in turn, should link innovation incentives to broader ESG strategies, ensuring a holistic integration that encompasses all ESG dimensions to enhance long-term competitiveness and sustainability. Social implications Adopting a broad ESG approach, rather than focusing on isolated aspects, is crucial for fostering sustainable innovation and generating societal benefits. Companies should assess ESG holistically, considering environmental, social and governance dimensions to maximize synergies with innovation. Stakeholder engagement and external cooperation are essential for developing effective and inclusive ESG initiatives. Furthermore, greater emphasis should be placed on the social dimension of ESG, which remains underdeveloped in many organizations. Future research could explore how small and medium-sized enterprises navigate this relationship and examine regional differences to better understand the social impact of ESG and innovation. Originality/value The results offer meaningful insights for corporate strategy, including the need for a holistic approach to intellectual capital management in ESG-driven innovation. In order to promote long-term sustainability and value creation, policymakers should encourage the alignment of innovation incentives with broader ESG frameworks.",294931066,0,91,,

Evidence from Indonesian Mining,"Meilenia Rahma Salisa, Yudisthira Jannata Muhammad Isa",Research Horizon,2025,"This study explores the influence of asset retirement obligations and firm size on environmental, social, and governance disclosure, with Sharia index inclusion as a moderating factor among mining companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2021 to 2024. The aim is to assess how environmental liabilities and organizational resources affect environmental, social, and governance disclosure and whether Sharia compliance modifies these relationships, contributing to ESG and Islamic finance literature. The research analyzes panel data from mining firms using moderated regression to evaluate the impact of asset retirement obligations, firm size, and Sharia index inclusion on environmental, social, and governance disclosure. Findings show that of asset retirement obligations and firm size positively influence ESG disclosure, driven by transparency needs and resource availability. However, Sharia index inclusion does not strengthen the asset retirement obligations environmental, social, and governance link, as firms view reclamation as a financial burden rather than a sustainability commitment. Conversely, it enhances the firm size-environmental, social, and governance relationship, reflecting higher stakeholder expectations for Sharia-compliant firms. The study highlights of asset retirement obligations and firm size as key drivers of ESG disclosure, with Sharia compliance amplifying the size effect but not environmental commitments. It offers practical insights for regulators, investors, and managers to foster sustainable governance in resource-intensive sectors.",294983172,0,43,,

For the empirical analysis, quantile regression models were applied at τ = 0.05, τ = 0.50. and τ = 0.95, allowing the capture of heterogeneous effects of ESG performance. The results reveal that smaller companies face significant obstacles in implementing ESG practices, particularly due to financial and operational constraints. In contrast, larger companies demonstrate greater capacity to internalize the benefits of these practices, which is reflected in improved corporate performance. The study contributes to the ongoing debate by showing that the impact of ESG initiatives is not uniform, varying according to the pillar considered and the size of the organization.

Drawing on data from China’s A-share listed firms from 2006 to 2022, this study empirically examines the impact of ESG environmental performance on corporate performance. The results reveal that ESG environmental performance significantly enhances corporate performance. This finding remains robust after addressing potential endogeneity by employing analyst attention as an instrumental variable and treating the implementation of the Environmental Protection Law as a quasi-natural experiment. The mechanism analysis indicates that green innovation serves as a crucial channel through which ESG environmental performance promotes corporate performance. Further, the moderating analysis shows that firms with stronger market competitiveness amplify the positive effect of ESG environmental performance on corporate performance. This amplification arises from the dual mechanism of strengthening the contribution of green innovation to firm performance while simultaneously weakening the driving effect of ESG environmental performance on green innovation. The heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the positive impact of ESG environmental performance on corporate performance is more pronounced among non-state-owned enterprises, firms with executives holding green backgrounds, companies without environmental penalties, and those operating in non-high-tech and non-high-pollution industries. Overall, this study provides theoretical support for corporate green transformation and offers valuable policy implications for optimizing sustainable development strategies.",295188130,0,9,,

Using the GRI-G4 framework and prior academic models, a multidimensional HCD index was developed to measure disclosure across employment, health and safety, training, diversity, and human rights. Content analysis and panel regression reveal that while companies extensively report on health, safety, and training, disclosures regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and human rights remain limited and inconsistent. These findings underscore selective disclosure practices, with firms prioritizing reputationally safer domains while underreporting sensitive issues. The study contributes theoretically by extending stakeholder, signaling, and information disclosure perspectives to the Indian ESG context and methodologically by offering a replicable coding scheme that captures disclosure depth. Practical implications underscore the need for managers to enhance DEI reporting.

This radical technological change in the economy is linked to the emergence and development of artificial intelligence and effective knowledge management, which are the main drivers of economic growth. The use of AI today can be traced in many different areas of applied science—medicine, physics, mathematics, and engineering design, including modeling, planning, and management of territorial systems. The accumulation of large databases and other information necessary for AI to function is directly related to the spatial aspects of economic development, which is also based on local potential (a place-based approach). At the same time, local knowledge resources and innovation potential are not fully utilized in the context of technology diffusion and AI implementation in individual countries and regions. In this regard, this study aims to analyze the role of regional innovation systems, with a focus on AI development, and to track their impact across individual European regions, using NUTS2 spatial-level data to ensure objectivity. The authors consider AI innovation a modern tool for decision-making in the implementation of regional policy, with a specific impact on cohesion between EU regions. The results of the study show a direct link between the localization of regional innovation systems, R &amp; D expenditure, AI implementation, and the economic development of European regions. Important factors influencing this process are the degree of Internet coverage, the capacity to generate innovation, the degree of AI implementation in the individual economic sectors of the countries, the growth of the ICT sector in relation to the overall development of GDP and the economy, and the result of the smart specialisation of regional innovation systems.",295270862,0,62,,

The aim of this literature review is to identify, document, and analyze the key performance indicators (KPIs) applied in the sector, with emphasis on environmental, social, and economic dimensions, and to investigate the extent to which technical energy interventions are linked to business and consumer benefits. The methodology was inspired by the general logic of organized search and selection procedures, and for this reason, elements of the PRISMA framework were used, with a search conducted across multiple international scientific databases and selection criteria ensuring the validity and relevance of the sources. The analysis classified the indicators into the following three categories: environmental (e.g., CO2 emissions, energy consumption), social (e.g., customer satisfaction, corporate image), and economic (e.g., ESG score, return on investment). The study revealed substantial progress made by supermarket chains globally in adopting energy-efficiency technologies, such as LED lighting and renewable energy with proven benefits in reducing consumption and consequently, improving environmental performance. However, a lack of holistic integration between technical interventions and social-economic indicators was identified, limiting the use of KPIs as a strategic tool for guiding specific sustainability strategies. This research concludes that there is a need to develop unified, sector-specific measurement frameworks that integrate environmental, social, and economic parameters, as well as empirical research that quantitatively connects energy strategies with business and consumer performance through comparable indicators in the context of supermarket operations, thereby opening ground for further exploration of the field.",295319179,0,32,,

Bibliometric and thematic analyses indicate a sharp post-2015 increase in publications, diffusion of complex architectures (deep neural networks, ensemble methods), and rising attention to explainable AI (XAI). Contemporary ML algorithms deliver substantial improvements in the accuracy, speed, and reliability of risk forecasts relative to traditional approaches [2], while limitations in interpretability and production-level implementation persist.

The scientific novelty of the article lies in the comprehensive systematization of AI methods by types of financial risks (credit, market, operational, fraud/AML) with consideration of XAI, as well as the development of a structured roadmap for AI implementation for banks and regulators. The practical significance lies in a set of specific recommendations for the development of data infrastructure, model risk management processes, XAI tools, and SupTech solutions designed for use by financial organizations and supervisory authorities in Kazakhstan.",296186949,0,9,,

Additionally, this research explores how investors distinguish between disclosures that represent genuine commitment to sustainability and those that may be indicative of “greenwashing,” and how such distinctions impact their assessment of an issuer’s credibility as well as the issuer’s performance subsequent to the issuance of a “green” bond. The methodology employed in this research employs a convergent mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative methods (Natural Language Processing (“NLP”), financial modeling, etc.) with qualitative methodologies (case studies, interviews). The NLP methodology employed in this research includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and ambiguity measurement in order to determine the tone, thematic content, and linguistic clarity of the disclosure texts. Subsequently, the results of the NLP methodologies are correlated with firm level outcomes using cross validated partial least squares regression (“PLS-R”), event study methodologies, and one way ANOVA to test for temporal and industrial variability. Finally, the results of the computational and financial methodologies are supplemented by qualitative case studies and interviews to provide context for the patterns identified in the computational and financial methodologies. In summary, the results of this research demonstrate that firms that communicate in a clear, balanced, and verifiable manner experience better market reaction and more favorable accounting results subsequent to the issuance of a “green” bond than do firms whose communications are vague, overly optimistic, or lacking in consistency. Conversely, the findings suggest that investors have become increasingly sensitive to potential “greenwashing” and therefore are less likely to respond favorably to communications characterized by the aforementioned characteristics.",296214374,0,23,,
10.5281/zenodo.18008872,"Agentic AI for Autonomous, Explainable, and Real-Time Credit Risk Decision-Making",Chandra Sekhar Kubam,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),2024,"Significant digitalization of financial services in a short period of time has led to an urgent demand to have autonomous, transparent and real-time credit risk decision making systems. The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting highdimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.",296216360,0,14,,

Yahya Surya Winata, Wanda Ramansyah, Sulton Nawawi, Riva Ananada Yuanova Kamajaya, Adam Muhammad Mansur, Adamu Muhammed",EPJ Web of Conferences,2025,"Current technological developments, particularly in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP), have significantly improved question-answering systems. This technology can be utilized in the fields of education and religion, particularly in the study of hadith. One challenge in hadith learning is the large number of reference sources contained in the Kutubut Tis’ah (nine main hadith books), making it time-consuming for users to find relevant answers. Therefore, a system capable of providing fast, accurate, and appropriate answers based on the hadith text is needed. This research aims to develop an artificial intelligence-based chatbot, called kutubBot, to answer questions related to Kutubut Tis’ah. This system employs a Transformer-based Question Answering approach to comprehend user questions and provide relevant answers based on the hadith corpus. The research stages included data collection from nine hadith books, text preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Test results showed that KutubBot achieved good results, with an 97.8% accuracy, 90.3% average precision, 93.45% recall, and an F1-score of 91.86%. These evaluation values indicate that the system has a high level of accuracy and completeness in providing answers that are contextually relevant to the hadith.",296218868,0,29,,

This study examines how FinTech development affects financial sustainability, using institutional preparedness as a moderating variable and digital transformation as a mediating factor. The study uses fixed-effects panel regression analysis to investigate cross-regional dynamics using a panel dataset of 18 rising economies in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia from 2015 to 2025. FinTech development considerably improves financial sustainability, according to empirical studies (β = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), with digital transformation processes mediating about 38% of this benefit. This association is further strengthened by institutional preparedness, suggesting that regulatory frameworks and governance quality are crucial for maintaining FinTech-driven growth. Southeast Asia has the strongest correlation between FinTech adoption and sustainability, according to regional studies, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa's influence is still limited by policy and infrastructure constraints. The results highlight how FinTech may promote equitable and sustainable financial systems when it is backed by strong digital governance. It is recommended that policymakers advance financial literacy, improve digital infrastructure, and include ESG principles into FinTech regulations. This study advances our theoretical and practical knowledge of how FinTech may promote digital inclusion, economic resilience, and sustainable financial growth in developing nations.",296321563,0,27,,

Using Thailand as a representative case due to limited historical information, this study constructs a realistic simulated SET ESG Index using free-float-adjusted market capitalization and semiannual rebalancing rules that reflect the methodology of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Using this index as the forecasting target, this study compares traditional statistical time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX) with seven deep learning architectures (RNN, GRU, LSTM, DF-RNN, DeepAR, DSSM, Deep Renewal) to evaluate performance in multi-step (36-day) prediction. Results reveal that deep learning models significantly outperform statistical approaches, with GRU delivering the highest accuracy and the most consistent robustness across reduced-data scenarios. These findings highlight the ability of advanced AI techniques to capture nonlinear ESG market dynamics better.

This review synthesizes global evidence on Islamic finance and extracts key lessons that can inform Uganda’s efforts to enhance socioeconomic empowerment through ethical and inclusive financial systems. Employing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by the PRISMA framework, the research synthesizes evidence from 48 peer-reviewed articles published between 2022 and 2025. The review highlights core Islamic finance principles—namely the prohibition of riba (interest), promotion of risk-sharing, and adherence to ethical and socially responsible practices—as foundational drivers of inclusive finance, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development. Despite Uganda’s recent regulatory reforms aimed at integrating Islamic finance into its financial system, actual uptake remains limited. This is largely attributed to persistent structural barriers, gaps in legal infrastructure, and low levels of public awareness and financial literacy regarding Islamic finance models. The findings reveal that Islamic finance, rooted in the objectives of Maqasid al-Shari'ah, holds promise in enhancing financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and community resilience. However, successful integration requires context-sensitive implementation, robust Shariah governance, public awareness, and supportive legal infrastructure. The study concludes by recommending a dual financial system and strategic use of technology to scale ethical finance models like Islamic finance that align with Uganda’s Vision 2040 and the Sustainable Development Goals.",296720324,0,93,,

Secondary data were obtained from 121 observations of banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during 2018–2023, covering the pre, during, and post COVID-19 periods. ESG performance was measured using the Bumi Global Karbon (BGK) Foundation score, while Tobin's Q ratio was used to calculate firm value. Panel data regression with a Fixed Effect Model under the Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) approach was employed. The results show that ESG has a negative effect on firm value, while the ESG ROA interaction has a significantly positive effect, indicating that profitability strengthens ESG’s contribution to firm value. Control variables, leverage, and firm size were found insignificant. The findings highlight the need for financial readiness before intensive ESG adoption and the importance of regulatory incentives to promote ESG implementation without reducing profitability.",296738436,0,44,,

This study pioneers a six-decade, cross-national empirical analysis (1960–2020) that distinguishes between the pre-1990 “outcome-proxy” era and the post-1990 institutionalized ESG era, offering the first long-term assessment of ESG ethics in disaster mitigation. Moving beyond purely financial or technical framings, the research conceptualizes ESG investments as morally significant interventions that integrate environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and governance accountability. Using fixed-effects panel regressions with robust errors, sub-period tests, and inter-sectoral interaction terms on datasets from the World Bank and Our World in Data, the study examines how ESG indicators shape both the frequency and economic damages of natural disasters. Results indicate that institutionalized ESG frameworks significantly enhance disaster resilience, while environmental and governance capacities act as key mediators of climate adaptation. By linking ESG performance to intergenerational justice, the study extends sustainability discourse beyond finance into ethics, governance, and policy design. This research thus pioneers a long-term, cross-national analysis connecting ESG ethics to intergenerational disaster resilience, providing original insights for ethical climate governance and sustainable finance policy.",296805624,0,27,,

10.1111/corg.70025,Government Environmental Attention and the Stock Price Crash Risk: From the Perspectives of External and Internal Governance,"Zhihuan Liang, Jinyu Chen, Shijie Ding",Corporate Governance An International Review,2026,"ABSTRACT Research Question/Issue Based on the section of the future work plan in the government work report, this study explores how government environmental attention influences the stock price crash risk and the role of internal and external corporate governance in this process. Research Findings/Insights This study takes the sample of heavily polluting industry firms listed on Chinese A‐shares from 2011 to 2020 and finds that government environmental attention can effectively reduce the stock price crash risk. The mechanism analysis suggests that government environmental attention mitigates crash risk by reducing information asymmetry. The improvement of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms can enhance the dampening effect of government environmental attention on the crash risk. Theoretical/Academic Implications First, our study offers a new perspective for exploring the determinants of crash risk and enriches the literature on the role of government environmental attention in financial markets. Second, we make a significant contribution to the literature on the attention‐based view. We not only enrich the application of the attention‐based view, but also provide new theoretical grounding for how government influences corporate behavior through soft constraints such as environmental attention. Third, our study advances the theoretical understanding of corporate governance by integrating the attention‐based view and the perspectives of internal and external governance. It emphasizes the “amplifier” role of internal and external governance mechanisms in transmitting governmental environmental attention.

Specifically, the relationships between artificial intelligence (AI), collective intelligence (CI), and human experience (HE) are conceptualized, and different evolutionary scenarios are designed on the basis of the interdependencies and their intensity. At the socio-economic level, the relationship between AI and CI can be investigated by analyzing the relationships between these two concepts and two other concepts that underpin the functioning of current societies, namely democracy and capitalism. Similarly, at the ontological level, the relationship between AI and HE can be analyzed by examining how the latter relates to fundamental concepts such as language and the codification of reality.",297103709,0,39,,

At the same time that these technologies are becoming more integrated into routine operations, the focus has shifted to the ethical and environmental consequences associated with their widespread application. An investigation of the operational sustainability associated with the generative artificial intelligence systems would be crucial, as it would provide information about how these systems match ideals such as efficiency, circularity and environmental responsibility. We explore how users understand and engage with sustainability principles, specifically lean, circular and green operational frameworks within generative artificial intelligence environments. We collect user reviews of 72 recently launched generative AI platforms from 2022 to 2024 and utilise advanced machine learning methods, including Word2Vec modelling, sentiment and regression analysis, to reveal how text datasets reflect customer perceptions. We find that the lean theme is the most prominent feature of operational sustainability, with the highest sentiment score, followed by the green and circular themes.

Using firm-level data spanning more than two decades, we analyze the effects of positive and negative ESG events on market-based (sales) and accounting-based (return on assets; ROA) performance for firms with and without brand capital investment (BCI). Using panel data on U.S. firms from 1995 to 2019, we compare firms that invest in brand capital through advertising with firms that do not. The results reveal an interesting asymmetric pattern. Specifically, BCI firms experience greater sales gains following positive ESG occurrences but incur significantly larger losses following negative ESG events. Interestingly, non-BCI firms benefit less from positive ESG activities but face smaller penalties from negative ESG occurrences. This study contributes to the marketing literature by examining brand capital investment and how ESG activities translate into performance gains versus when they impose performance costs for firms.",297452735,0,94,,

Using ESG scores and corporate financial data from Bloomberg, three panel models were estimated: a random-effects model for ROA, a fixed-effects model for ROE, controlling for size, leverage, growth, and cash flow, and a test for sectoral differences between energy and non-energy companies. The results indicate that governance scores are positively associated with ROA (β = 0.011, p = 0.092), whereas ESG scores are weakly positively associated with ROA (β = 0.020, p = 0.080). Environmental and social scores are not statistically significant to ROA or ROE. For ROE, firm size is the main significant predictor (β = 2.126, p = 0.042). The results observe significant differences between the energy and non-energy sectors, with the energy sector reporting higher financial performance after controlling for ESG. Finally, this study indicates that ESG reporting policies that promote good governance can yield faster returns to shareholders.AcknowledgmentThis study was supported by the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Greater Education and Al-Madani School of Economic Sciences.&amp;amp;nbsp;",297456705,0,47,,

This study addresses this gap by investigating how ESG sensemaking capability mediates the relationship between GenAI integration and environmental performance, analyzing how sustainability information overload moderates the relationship between technological adoption and ESG sensemaking, and exploring the influence of regulatory uncertainty on the link between ESG sensemaking and environmental performance. Drawing upon organizational information processing theory (OIPT), the study develops and tests a conceptual framework using data collected from 610 firms. The results indicate that GenAI integration enhances environmental performance both directly and indirectly through improved ESG sensemaking. However, when sustainability‐related information becomes excessive, this positive effect weakens. In contrast, regulatory uncertainty amplifies the beneficial relationship between ESG sensemaking and environmental outcomes. These findings highlight that technology adoption alone does not guarantee sustainability gains; organizational interpretive capacity is important. This study extends OIPT by introducing ESG sensemaking capability as a distinct interpretive mechanism that bridges information‐processing fit and sustainability outcomes, distinguishing it from absorptive and dynamic capabilities. In addition to empirical evidence, we validate our findings through triangulation with real‐world use cases.",297491614,0,59,,

Using a sample of 110 listed banks across 18 developing countries from 2012–2013 to 2021–2022, this study employs regression analysis to assess the impact of GWS on FP. The study uses the peer‐relative GWS score by Yu et al. and introduces boardroom diversity and ESG controversies as moderating variables to analyze their influence on the GWS‐FP relationship. The findings reveal that GWS negatively affects the FP of banks in developing economies. Furthermore, the presence of female directors on bank boards moderates this relationship, reducing the financial penalties associated with GWS. ESG controversies, on the other hand, amplify the negative impact of GWS on FP, indicating the importance of a holistic approach to sustainability. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature by examining the nexus between GWS and FP, specifically within the banking sector of developing economies—a context that has received limited attention.

Existing research has focused on green finance’s impact on corporate environmental performance, failing to account for the complex regional mechanisms that shape its contribution to systemic sustainability. This study fills the gaps by examining the mechanism and spatial heterogeneity of green finance’s influences on regional sustainability measured by environmental performance. Using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces during 2010–2022, it shows that green finance increased from 0.318 to 0.539, while environmental performance improved from 0.441 to 0.656. The empirical evidence demonstrates that green finance has a robust positive effect on environmental performance, acting as an effective tool for environmental governance. This impact is primarily channeled through technological innovation and green consumption, with environmental regulation providing a synergistic moderating role. Furthermore, significant regional heterogeneity in sustainability outcomes is observed, while the effect is strongest in eastern China, unstable or negligible in old industrial bases, and unexpectedly negative in ecologically fragile Northwest China. The disparities are attributed to variations in local economic structure, institutional capacity, and development stage. Corresponding policy recommendations include improving the institutional framework, channeling financial resources to green technology R&amp;D and sustainable consumption incentives, integrating green finance with environmental policies, and implementing region-specific strategies. This study offers practical benchmarks for China and other developing economies to leverage green finance as a driver of sustainable development.",297594109,0,37,,

The paper is based on a 5-year longitudinal database for 150 publicly traded agribusiness firms with a total of 750 firm-year observations. The results show that one point increase in the ESG disclosure score is related to an increase in market capitalization by about USD 0.45 billion (p = 0.000). In addition, ESG disclosure has a positive relationship with investor sentiment, with a coefficient of 0.35 (p = 0.000), meaning that the more transparency there is, the more positive the investors' perception. The results also confirm that corporate governance quality is positively associated with the quality and reliability of ESG disclosure, thus promoting long-term investment. Overall, this study underlines the increasing importance of ESG factors in shaping the market performance and investor engagement of agribusiness.

 Among the various literature streams, the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) on company's value drivers has raised importance from both stakeholders' and shareholders' perspectives. In this context, the systematic risk component (CAPM's beta) emerges as a critical factor that needs to be deeply analyzed, taking into account ESG. Since the relationship between ESG and the systematic risk is largely controversial, this study aims to explore this latter by also considering the moderating role played by two types of internal controls: the audit committee independence and the ESG‐related executive compensation. To reach the target, an analysis on a sample of 200 non‐financial European listed companies observed from 2015 to 2023 has been performed with a fixed effects estimator and random forest. Findings reveal an inverted U‐shaped relationship between ESG score and beta as well as a moderating role played by the internal controls, providing several theoretical and practical contributions.",297783187,0,46,,

Evidence from Financial Restatements in China,"Qiming Pan, Huiying Jia",Sustainability,2026,"This study investigates the “insurance-like effect” of corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance amid financial restatement events among Chinese listed firms and examines the moderating role of ESG rating divergence. Employing an event study methodology on a sample of 1552 financial restatement events in China’s A-share market from 2013 to 2023, we measure market reactions using the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) over a [−1, +1] day window. Our findings reveal that strong ESG performance significantly mitigates the negative market reactions triggered by financial restatements. However, this protective effect of ESG is significantly weakened by the inconsistency in ESG assessments among rating agencies, known as ESG rating divergence, particularly when such divergence is persistent. We argue that the underlying mechanism is that rating divergence creates signal conflicts, exacerbates information asymmetry, and erodes the credibility of ESG signals. This, in turn, undermines the stakeholder trust and moral capital that underpin the insurance-like effect. This research sheds light on the complex impact of ESG rating divergence on the value-protective mechanism of ESG and contributes new empirical evidence to the literature on ESG and its insurance-like effect, especially within the context of an emerging market.",297806821,0,164,,

 This study investigates how ethically salient service dimensions, service quality, digital trust and security, and accessibility, shape user satisfaction and adoption of e‐payment systems in fragile contexts. Drawing on a structured survey of 370 e‐payment users in Kismayo, Jubbaland State of Somalia, and employing correlation and regression analyses, the study provides one of the first large‐sample, quantitative examinations of digital finance adoption in Somalia. Framed within an ethically extended technology acceptance model (TAM), supported by institutional and contingency perspectives, the analysis reinterprets service quality as a proxy for perceived usefulness, accessibility as an expression of perceived ease of use, and trust/security as a critical extension variable. Fairness in access is further introduced as a measurable ethical construct reflecting digital justice and inclusion. Results show that these constructs significantly enhance customer satisfaction, which in turn predicts adoption. Unlike prior research that treats e‐payment adoption as purely technical or behavioral, this study positions the ethical extension of TAM as its central contribution, offering theoretical and practical insights for inclusive and resilient digital finance in fragile economies.",297808739,0,29,,

Although these models are powerful, they are also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, such as bypassing security mechanisms to generate harmful content or executing unauthorized operations. Therefore, ensuring the security of LLMs is crucial for maintaining network security and user trust. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage defense framework called EssenceGuard, aimed at enhancing the security of LLMs through essence analysis. The core of the EssenceGuard is essence analysis, which includes two main stages: intent analysis and strategy analysis. In the intent analysis stage, it aims to detect whether the user input attempts to mask the true intent, such as using indirect language, fictional scenarios, or other mask methods. In the strategy analysis stage, further analysis is conducted on the specific strategies that might have been used, such as encoding conversion, metaphor, or fictional scenarios. By combining the results of these two stages of analysis, EssenceGuard can more accurately assess the risk of user input and generate more secure responses. EssenceGuard introduces in-context learning and complex evaluation logic to maintain a low Attack Success Rate (ASR) while reducing the False Positive Rate (FPR) for benign user queries. Additionally, EssenceGuard provides a transparent feedback mechanism to explain to users why their queries are judged to be harmful or harmless, thereby enhancing user trust. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the EssenceGuard framework and show the framework excels in detecting malicious attacks and reducing false positive rate.",297835173,0,41,,

 This study investigates the relationship between greenwashing (GWS) and the financial performance (FP) of banks in developing economies, focusing on two critical moderating factors: boardroom diversity and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) controversies. Using a sample of 110 listed banks across 18 developing countries from 2012–2013 to 2021–2022, this study employs regression analysis to assess the impact of GWS on FP. The study uses the peer‐relative GWS score by Yu et al. and introduces boardroom diversity and ESG controversies as moderating variables to analyze their influence on the GWS‐FP relationship. The findings reveal that GWS negatively affects the FP of banks in developing economies. Furthermore, the presence of female directors on bank boards moderates this relationship, reducing the financial penalties associated with GWS. ESG controversies, on the other hand, amplify the negative impact of GWS on FP, indicating the importance of a holistic approach to sustainability. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature by examining the nexus between GWS and FP, specifically within the banking sector of developing economies—a context that has received limited attention.

It is dangerous to lenders and buyers. Credit-scored by the past methods are prone to bank only on the partially constrained economic history. This reduces accurate borrower scoring and increases the chance of default. Simultaneously, an open-peer financial system community of investors of another nature must venture into uncertainty, as a result of a lack of transparency, compliance and economic literacy among contributors. In order to overcome those limitations, we, in this paper, provide credit score perception to the next Jen: artificial intelligence (AI), Compliance and merger of investor Trust, a massive platform designed to make lending decisions in digital finance and enhance long-term thinking. The solution capitalizes on the blessings of AI to perform multidimensional credit scoring, an integration of conduct, transactions and non-public insights that may extend beyond the conventional credit-scoring approaches. Automatic compliance refers to check -in compliance that protects each borrower and investors. Moreover, the platform is an academic center with interactive gaining knowledge of modules and AI- assisted monetary schooling to promote monetary literacy and duty borrowing. To borrowers, the machine provides hints of personal debt rights analysis and reimbursement policy.

10.3390/accountaudit2010002,The Impact of ESG Factors on Corporate Credit Risk: An Empirical Analysis of European Firms Using the Altman Z-Score,"Cinzia Baldan, Francesco Zen, Margherita Targhetta",Accounting and Auditing,2026,"Background: The increasing integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into financial decision-making has prompted debate over their impact on corporate credit risk. While many studies suggest that ESG performance may enhance firms’ resilience, empirical evidence remains mixed due to data inconsistency and methodological heterogeneity and differences in time horizons over which ESG effects materialise. Methods: The study investigates the relationship between ESG performance and credit risk using a panel of European firms from 2020 to 2024, a phase highly characterised by substantial macroeconomic shocks. The Altman Z-score serves as a proxy for default risk, while ESG data are sourced from Refinitiv Eikon. Four fixed-effects panel regressions are estimated: a baseline model using aggregate ESG scores, an extended model with financial controls, and disaggregated and sector-specific models. Results: The findings indicate that ESG scores—either aggregated or by pillar—show limited statistical significance in explaining variations in the Z-score. In contrast, financial variables such as solvency, liquidity, and cash flow ratios display strong, positive, and significant effects on credit stability. Some heterogeneous sectoral effects emerge: social factors are positive in technology, while governance has a negative impact in basic materials. Conclusions: ESG initiatives may not yield immediate improvements in default risk metrics, particularly over short and crisis-dominated periods, but could enhance financial resilience over time. Combining ESG information with traditional financial ratios remains essential; the results underscore the importance of consistent and high-quality ESG disclosure to reduce measurement error and enhance comparability across firms.",297957301,0,25,,

Using the PRISMA framework, we map the intellectual evolution of the field, identifying a significant shift from foundational parametric models to data‐driven approaches. While early research focused on simple covariance‐based metrics, the field has recently been transformed by significant technical advances. Our network analysis identifies five major thematic clusters ranging from market dynamics and liquidity definitions to microstructure in high‐frequency and volatile environments. We highlight a critical research priority: utilizing high‐frequency data to validate low‐frequency models for reliable application in unobserved contexts, such as emerging markets and decentralized finance (DeFi). The findings underscore the enduring relevance of estimators in construction of long‐span historical series and noise‐adjusted liquidity measures.

These practices pose direct threats to internationally protected human rights, particularly the rights to privacy, dignity, equality, freedom of expression, and participation in public life. The article demonstrates that current international and domestic responses struggle to address challenges related to attribution of responsibility, enforcement, and victim protection in cases involving synthetic media. It concludes that a more targeted, human-rights-based approach to AI-generated content is required, one that moves beyond general ethical principles and provides clear legal guidance, shared responsibility among key actors, and meaningful remedies for affected individuals. This article argues that although the United Nations has increasingly acknowledged the human rights risks associated with artificial intelligence, its existing governance frameworks remain largely abstract and insufficiently tailored to the specific harms caused by AI-generated content. The absence of precise legal standards and enforceable obligations has contributed to fragmented national responses, inconsistent platform accountability, and limited access to effective remedies for victims.

We conducted a detailed literature search in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and identified 73 papers published between 2016 and 2023 as the sample, covering annual trends, country and industry distribution, theoretical frameworks, proxy variables, research methods, research results, and provided direction for future research. We found a significant increase in the number of studies over the past 3 years. Cross‐country studies dominated the field, with most research adopting multi‐industry analysis, while studies focusing on a single industry were relatively rare. The stakeholder theory and agency theory were the most widely applied theories. Most studies showed that ESG performance had a positive effect on firm value, reflecting the growing importance that markets and investors placed on ESG performance and its contribution to long‐term firm growth. However, some studies reported negative or insignificant effects, noting that the effects of ESG performance varied by industry, region, and market environment. This study suggests that future research should explore the independent and interactive effects of each ESG dimension on firm value, focusing on dynamic relationships across industries and regions, using new methods and models, and incorporating moderating variables. This study provides practical guidance for firm managers and policymakers to optimize ESG practices, enhancing firm value and promoting sustainability.",279781517,19,71,,

It explores the antecedents, decisions and outcomes (ADO) influencing ESG investments; theories used in the literature; publication years, geographical locations and journals of publication of ESG-related articles; notable gaps in research on ESG investments; theoretical and managerial implications and prospective research avenues within the ESG field. All ESG components are interconnected with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Design/methodology/approachThe PRISMA framework was employed to screen articles from the Scopus database. A total of 386 articles spanning 2011–2024 were included. The search terms used to screen the articles for inclusion were “sustainable finance,” “ESG,” “environment, social, corporate governance,” “green finance,” “green bond,” “social bond,” “blue bond,” “social finance” and “corporate social responsibility.”FindingsThe findings indicate that organizations utilize green bonds, blue bonds and green loans to mitigate environmental concerns. To address social issues, companies issue social bonds and sustainable bonds and engage in socially responsible investing. To address concerns about corporate governance, companies emphasize corporate social responsibility and intellectual capital.Practical implicationsThe findings can be used to inform policymakers on the implementation of comprehensive regulatory frameworks in the realm of ESG. Tax benefits and subsidies should be extended to firms fostering ESG practices.Originality/valueThis study offers a comprehensive synthesis of the ESG literature by examining the ADO framework, which has not been systematically applied to ESG investments before. It integrates diverse components of ESG investments with the United Nations’ SDGs, providing a unique perspective on how these investments align with global sustainability objectives.",283019275,19,112,,

The systematic literature review was based on a bibliometric analysis of articles found in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The search was confined to materials published between 2000 and August 2023. After applying criteria limiting the search, the final result was 869 unique literature items which were later analysed towards establishing the relationship of ESG and climate-related risks (‘new banking risks’) with other (so-called ‘traditional’) banking risks and identifying research gaps at the interface between traditional and new banking risks. This article introduces a variety of findings, including the most productive authors, organisations, countries and journals, the most cited articles and keyword distribution. In addition, a map of the evolution of the approach to ESG risk in banking was constructed on the basis of the literature review. The study identified 11 clusters of banking risk influenced by ESG risk and 10 clusters of banking risk affected by climate-related risk.",278488714,13,141,,
