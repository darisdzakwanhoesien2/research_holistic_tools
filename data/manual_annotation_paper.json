        "introduction": "# 1. Introduction\n\nThe concept of greenwashing began to gain wider attention in the late 1990s, with scholarly and public interest in the issue continuing to grow over the following decades [1]. Although research on this phenomenon has expanded significantly, the concept still lacks a single, universally accepted definition, and its interpretation remains open to debate [2]. It was originally applied to environmental issues and defined as \u201cthe intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance\u201d [3]. It was also referred to as \u201csymbolic corporate environmentalism\u201d [4]. Subsequently, the concept evolved into a broader interpretation, described as the \u201cselective disclosure of positive information about a company's environmental or social performance without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image\u201d [5] or the \u201cact of presenting a company's environmental and/or social performance in a misleading way\u201d [6]. Following the triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability and the principles of environmental integrity, social equity, and economic prosperity, addressing environmental, social, and economic issues has become essential to discussions of greenwashing [2].\n\nGreenwashing has been analyzed from various perspectives, with the literature presenting different conceptualizations of its relationship to similar notions. Some authors interpret it as a form of decoupling [7], highlighting the discrepancy between dissemination of symbolic statements (\u201ctalk\u201d) and actual actions (\u201cwalk\u201d) [8]. Others view greenwashing as a concept that describes decoupling processes within the context of sustainability, treating greenwashing and decoupling as synonyms [9,10,11]. Yet, Siano et al. [12] distinguish between two primary types of greenwashing: decoupling and attention deflection. In this context, decoupling refers to the gap between disclosure and performance [13] or between policy statements and actual corporate commitment [14], as well as the disconnection between means and ends [15]. It also includes impression management practices that involve \u201cempty green claims and policies\u201d and \u201csin of fibbing\u201d, in which companies make claims that are outright false [16]. Impression management encompasses emphasizing positive organizational outcomes (enhancement) or obfuscating negative organizational outcomes (concealment) [17].\n\nAttention deflection, as the act of concealing unethical business practices, encompasses various deceptive communication tactics, such as selective and inaccurate disclosure [5], including incomplete comparisons and vague or irrelevant statements [18]. It also involves misleading written texts and visual imagery [19] as well as unverifiable claims, such as implied superiority and the \u201csin of no proof\u201d, where assertions lack substantiating evidence or accessible supporting information [20].\n\nGreenwashing involves both the overstatement of positive performance and the concealment of negative information [21,22]. It encompasses a broad range of practices commonly characterized by the dissemination of misleading information [23], including various forms of false claims rooted in hypocrisy and/or deception [24]. Some authors connect greenwashing with the obfuscation of negative sustainability information, suggesting that companies with inferior sustainability performance use complex, ambiguous language to produce intentionally opaque or confusing reports [25]. This means that greenwashing can be identified through linguistic patterns, which often rely on overly optimistic terms that emphasize positive aspects. Accordingly, the literature on greenwashing is closely related to research on selective disclosure, in which favorable information is emphasized while unfavorable details are minimized or omitted [26].\n\nIn this paper, we refer to greenwashing in sustainability reporting as the deliberate or unintended dissemination of misleading, incomplete, or overly favorable sustainability-related disclosures. It is manifested through the selective presentation of positive information, the concealment or obfuscation of negative performance, or the decoupling of reported claims from underlying organizational practices. This process constructs an unjustifiably positive impression of corporate sustainability by overstating positive actions and concealing negative ones.\nThe complex and often ambiguous nature of greenwashing presents substantial methodological challenges for researchers attempting to identify and measure it. At the same time, these challenges offer valuable opportunities for future inquiry [27]. However, there remains a limited understanding regarding the strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and the approaches used to measure it, including their operationalization, methodologies, and data sources applied in this field [28]. In particular, approaches based on content analysis are especially valuable and offer significant conceptual and empirical insights, given that much of the existing research on greenwashing relies on indicators derived from secondary sources such as dedicated databases and specific ratings, which are not always transparent, are often binary, and may be arbitrary or highly autocorrelated. In fact, using composite ESG indicators derived from secondary sources typically provides only aggregated scores, obscuring which aspect of greenwashing is measured, reducing comparability across heterogeneous providers, and limiting replicability where access to commercial ESG databases is restricted [29,30,31].\n\nGrowing scholarly interest in greenwashing has resulted in the publication of several systematic literature reviews [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39] and bibliometric analyses that characterize the structure and trends in this scientific field [40,41,42,43]. Nonetheless, systematic literature reviews focusing specifically on the measurement of greenwashing [32] and greenwashing in sustainability reporting [44,45] remain scarce. This scarcity is particularly evident in relation to strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and to measurement approaches grounded in content-analysis studies.\n\nGiven these challenges and the rapidly expanding research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting, it is crucial to build on existing analyses to address persistent gaps and explore under-researched areas.\n\nThe main aim of this paper, therefore, is to systematically organize and synthesize the current literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies in this field. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive syntheses to date of strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and provide an integrated, conceptually grounded overview of existing approaches and analytical techniques used to measure and detect greenwashing through content analysis. In particular, our systematic literature review aims to address the following research questions, which have not been sufficiently explored in existing research:What strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting have been identified in the literature?What content analysis--based measurement approaches are used to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting?\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the research methodology. In Section 3, the results are presented and discussed. Section 4 identifies areas for future research and Section 5 provides concluding remarks and acknowledges the study's limitations.",
        "abstract": "# Abstract\n\nThis paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of research on strategic positioning of companies and the measurement of greenwashing in sustainability reporting. Its main aim is to synthesize and organize the existing literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies. Drawing on a rigorous content analysis of 88 studies, we delineate strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and examine content-analysis-based measurement approaches used to detect it. Our SLR shows that most strategic typologies draw on theories such as legitimacy theory, impression management theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory. Several studies adopt a four-quadrant matrix with varying conceptual dimensions, while others classify strategic responses to institutional pressures along a passive-active continuum. However, the evidence suggests that to assume that companies uniformly pursue sustainability reporting strategies is a major oversimplification. The findings also indicate that the literature proposes a variety of innovative, content-analysis-based approaches aimed at capturing divergences between communicative claims and organizational realities\u2014most notably, discrepancies between disclosure and measurable performance, and between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions, as well as the identification of selective or manipulative communication practices that may signal greenwashing. Analytical techniques commonly focus on linguistic and visual cues in sustainability reports, including tone (sentiment and narrative framing), readability (both traditional readability indices and machine learning-based textual complexity measures), and visual content (selective emphasis, imagery framing, and graphic distortions). We also synthesize studies that document empirically verified instances of greenwashing and contrast them with research that, in our view, relies on overly simplified or untested assumptions. Based on this SLR, we identify central theoretical and methodological priorities for advancing the study of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and propose a research agenda to guide future research.",
        "materials_and_methods": "## 2. Materials and Methods\n\nWe conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. As a rigorous and structured research method, an SLR facilitates a comprehensive examination of scholarly works within a specific research domain. This approach enables the mapping and synthesis of existing knowledge while providing insight into the interconnections among studies. Furthermore, it supports the identification, classification, and critical evaluation of the current body of literature, thereby establishing a foundation for recognizing research gaps and proposing future research directions [28,35,46,47].\nThe SLR presented in this study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines [48]. The review utilized the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection databases, selected for their reliability, relevance, and frequent use in systematic reviews [35,49]. In addition, these databases are the most widely used citation indexes in the world, and, consequently, most bibliometric and scientometric tools are based on them [50,51].\n\nTo improve methodological robustness, the selection of search terms was informed by a comprehensive review of previous SLRs and bibliometric analyses on greenwashing [28,35,36,37,39], sustainability reporting [52,53,54,55], and research integrating both topics [45]. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the research field, a thorough search was conducted using keywords that combined terms related to greenwashing and sustainability reporting.\n\nFirst, we created a list of terms describing greenwashing activities, which included the following keywords: \u201cgreenwash\u201d, \u201cgreen wash\u201d, \u201cgreen-wash*\u201d, \u201cdecoupling\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d, \u201cobfuscation\u201d, and \u201cdeceptive\u201d.\n\nSecond, given the diverse terminology used in extensive sustainability reporting research, a detailed search was conducted using keywords such as \u201csustainability report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201csustainable development report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccorporate social responsibility report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cCSR report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cresponsib* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cESG report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccorporate citizenship report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ctriple bottom line report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cTBL report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGRI report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGlobal Reporting Initiative report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201csustainable development goal* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cSDG* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cintegr* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cnon-financ* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cenvironm* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cgreen report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGHG report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cgreenhouse gas report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccarbon report*/disclosure\u201d, and \u201csocial report*/disclosure\u201d.\n\nThe list of query words and the combined query string used in this study are provided in Table A1 and Table A2 in the Appendix A.\n\nNext, we defined the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review (Table A3 in the Appendix A). A study was considered eligible if the publication explicitly addressed the phenomenon of greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting as a primary research topic. In addition, the study had to discuss greenwashing strategies or methods for measuring greenwashing that were grounded in content analysis of sustainability reporting. We also specified that each study must operationalize at least one dimension of greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability reports or other corporate disclosures containing ESG-related information.\n\nFor the exclusion criteria, we omitted publications not written in English, reflecting the dominance of English in scientific communication [56] and reducing language and translation bias [28,57]. We also excluded books, book chapters, editorial materials, meeting abstracts, and data papers, as these document types typically do not undergo a rigorous peer-review process that ensures the reliability and credibility of empirical findings [58]. This approach is standard in many SLRs [28,49]. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table A3 in the Appendix A.\n\nThe search was conducted on 17 February 2025, utilizing the query string detailed in Table A2 in the Appendix A. After applying the initial exclusion criteria outlined in phase 1 (document type and language), 249 publications were identified in Scopus and 199 in WoS, resulting in a combined total of 448 records. Following the removal of 174 duplicate records from the two databases, the final dataset consisted of 274 unique publications. To organize key information throughout the process and to facilitate the identification and elimination of duplicates, we used a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\n\nIn the subsequent screening stage, the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the 274 publications were reviewed by two researchers (the co-authors) to assess their relevance to the\nstudy's objectives and determine eligibility for further analysis and data extraction. Each researcher independently screened all 274 publications to evaluate whether greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting constituted the primary focus of the article. They also assessed whether the study involved an empirical examination of greenwashing in corporate reporting in line with the predefined scope of the review. Based on these criteria, each publication was classified as either \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cexclude.\u201d In cases where a researcher\u2014after reviewing the title, keywords, and abstract\u2014was uncertain about whether a publication met the inclusion criteria, it was conservatively classified as \u201cinclude\u201d and was retained for full-text assessment in the next stage. To evaluate inter-rater (inter-coder) reliability for the binary inclusion/exclusion decision, the reviewers' assessments were compared and Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient was high (\u03ba = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78--0.91), indicating strong agreement between the two reviewers [59,60]. In cases where discrepancies between the researchers' decisions occurred, the publication was retained for full-text review in the next stage. As a result of this phase, 182 publications were retained for the research sample, while 92 were excluded as not relevant to the review's objectives. Full texts were subsequently retrieved for the 182 included studies. Only 4 publications could not be obtained. Additionally, 21 publications were identified through the snowballing method.\n\nIn the next stage, 178 publications identified through database searches and 21 additional publications identified via snowball sampling were subjected to in-depth full-text analysis. The same two researchers independently reviewed the full texts, applying inclusion criteria derived directly from the research questions: (1) the article discussed greenwashing strategies in the context of sustainability reporting as a central topic, or (2) the study presented and empirically applied at least one content-analysis-based approach to measuring greenwashing. Publications were excluded if greenwashing strategies or measurement approaches were addressed only tangentially, if no methods or approaches based on content analysis of sustainability reports or other ESG-related disclosures were presented or applied, or if all dimensions of greenwashing were operationalized exclusively through external ESG scores from global financial or non-financial data vendors. Inter-coder decisions were again compared, and Cohen's kappa was recalculated. Agreement for full-text eligibility reached 88% (95% CI: 0.81--0.95), indicating an almost perfect level of agreement [59,60]. In cases of disagreement, both researchers re-examined the publication, discussed their assessments, and reached a joint decision. Following this process, 88 publications were retained for further analysis (76 identified through database searches and 12 identified via snowball sampling).\n\nTo provide a clearer understanding of the process of searching and including publications in this review, the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.\n\nIn the final step of the SLR, a thematic content analysis was conducted to extract and synthesize data relevant to the research questions. A narrative synthesis approach was applied, combining systematic textual summarization with interpretive analysis of the findings, as appropriate given the objectives of this review [61,62]. Two researchers independently reviewed and coded the full texts of all publications to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. A combined deductive--inductive coding strategy was used. At the deductive level, the coding framework was structured around two main thematic groups of studies, corresponding to the research questions: (1) articles addressing strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and (2) articles presenting and applying content-analysis-based approaches and analytical techniques for measuring greenwashing.\n\nWithin each thematic group, additional codes were developed inductively to capture recurring concepts and patterns emerging from the material. For studies classified in the first group (strategic typologies), we coded the following elements: authorship,\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nthe theoretical framework(s) used, research sample characteristics, and the characteristics of strategic approaches. For studies classified in the second group (measurement approaches), we coded the following elements: authorship, the measurement approach or analytical technique used, research sample characteristics, the type of data, the method of data acquisition, and the sustainability focus of the measurement (environmental, social, and/or governance).\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1.

Source: Authors' elaboration based on [48].\n\nAll codes were documented in a shared Excel spreadsheet, which was used to organize, structure, and synthesize the extracted information and to compile Tables A4 and A5 in the Appendix A, providing a structured overview of the coded variables. Discrepancies\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nin coding between the two researchers were resolved through discussion, and any agreed refinements of the coding scheme were applied consistently across all publications.\n\nFigure 2 presents the quantitative descriptive characteristics of the analyzed publications, while the following section reports the results of the qualitative content analysis for the two thematic groups. Detailed characteristics of the studies included in the SLR are provided in Table A4 and Table A5 in the Appendix A.
