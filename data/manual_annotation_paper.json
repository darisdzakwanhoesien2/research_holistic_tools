Introduction\n\nThe concept of greenwashing began to gain wider attention in the late 1990s, with scholarly and public interest in the issue continuing to grow over the following decades [1]. Although research on this phenomenon has expanded significantly, the concept still lacks a single, universally accepted definition, and its interpretation remains open to debate [2]. It was originally applied to environmental issues and defined as \u201cthe intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance\u201d [3]. It was also referred to as \u201csymbolic corporate environmentalism\u201d [4]. Subsequently, the concept evolved into a broader interpretation, described as the \u201cselective disclosure of positive information about a company's environmental or social performance without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image\u201d [5] or the \u201cact of presenting a company's environmental and/or social performance in a misleading way\u201d [6]. Following the triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability and the principles of environmental integrity, social equity, and economic prosperity, addressing environmental, social, and economic issues has become essential to discussions of greenwashing [2].\n\nGreenwashing has been analyzed from various perspectives, with the literature presenting different conceptualizations of its relationship to similar notions. Some authors interpret it as a form of decoupling [7], highlighting the discrepancy between dissemination of symbolic statements (\u201ctalk\u201d) and actual actions (\u201cwalk\u201d) [8]. Others view greenwashing as a concept that describes decoupling processes within the context of sustainability, treating greenwashing and decoupling as synonyms [9,10,11]. Yet, Siano et al. [12] distinguish between two primary types of greenwashing: decoupling and attention deflection. In this context, decoupling refers to the gap between disclosure and performance [13] or between policy statements and actual corporate commitment [14], as well as the disconnection between means and ends [15]. It also includes impression management practices that involve \u201cempty green claims and policies\u201d and \u201csin of fibbing\u201d, in which companies make claims that are outright false [16]. Impression management encompasses emphasizing positive organizational outcomes (enhancement) or obfuscating negative organizational outcomes (concealment) [17].\n\nAttention deflection, as the act of concealing unethical business practices, encompasses various deceptive communication tactics, such as selective and inaccurate disclosure [5], including incomplete comparisons and vague or irrelevant statements [18]. It also involves misleading written texts and visual imagery [19] as well as unverifiable claims, such as implied superiority and the \u201csin of no proof\u201d, where assertions lack substantiating evidence or accessible supporting information [20].\n\nGreenwashing involves both the overstatement of positive performance and the concealment of negative information [21,22]. It encompasses a broad range of practices commonly characterized by the dissemination of misleading information [23], including various forms of false claims rooted in hypocrisy and/or deception [24]. Some authors connect greenwashing with the obfuscation of negative sustainability information, suggesting that companies with inferior sustainability performance use complex, ambiguous language to produce intentionally opaque or confusing reports [25]. This means that greenwashing can be identified through linguistic patterns, which often rely on overly optimistic terms that emphasize positive aspects. Accordingly, the literature on greenwashing is closely related to research on selective disclosure, in which favorable information is emphasized while unfavorable details are minimized or omitted [26].\n\nIn this paper, we refer to greenwashing in sustainability reporting as the deliberate or unintended dissemination of misleading, incomplete, or overly favorable sustainability-related disclosures. It is manifested through the selective presentation of positive information, the concealment or obfuscation of negative performance, or the decoupling of reported claims from underlying organizational practices. This process constructs an unjustifiably positive impression of corporate sustainability by overstating positive actions and concealing negative ones.\nThe complex and often ambiguous nature of greenwashing presents substantial methodological challenges for researchers attempting to identify and measure it. At the same time, these challenges offer valuable opportunities for future inquiry [27]. However, there remains a limited understanding regarding the strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and the approaches used to measure it, including their operationalization, methodologies, and data sources applied in this field [28]. In particular, approaches based on content analysis are especially valuable and offer significant conceptual and empirical insights, given that much of the existing research on greenwashing relies on indicators derived from secondary sources such as dedicated databases and specific ratings, which are not always transparent, are often binary, and may be arbitrary or highly autocorrelated. In fact, using composite ESG indicators derived from secondary sources typically provides only aggregated scores, obscuring which aspect of greenwashing is measured, reducing comparability across heterogeneous providers, and limiting replicability where access to commercial ESG databases is restricted [29,30,31].\n\nGrowing scholarly interest in greenwashing has resulted in the publication of several systematic literature reviews [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39] and bibliometric analyses that characterize the structure and trends in this scientific field [40,41,42,43]. Nonetheless, systematic literature reviews focusing specifically on the measurement of greenwashing [32] and greenwashing in sustainability reporting [44,45] remain scarce. This scarcity is particularly evident in relation to strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and to measurement approaches grounded in content-analysis studies.\n\nGiven these challenges and the rapidly expanding research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting, it is crucial to build on existing analyses to address persistent gaps and explore under-researched areas.\n\nThe main aim of this paper, therefore, is to systematically organize and synthesize the current literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies in this field. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive syntheses to date of strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and provide an integrated, conceptually grounded overview of existing approaches and analytical techniques used to measure and detect greenwashing through content analysis. In particular, our systematic literature review aims to address the following research questions, which have not been sufficiently explored in existing research:What strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting have been identified in the literature?What content analysis--based measurement approaches are used to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting?\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the research methodology. In Section 3, the results are presented and discussed. Section 4 identifies areas for future research and Section 5 provides concluding remarks and acknowledges the study's limitations."
