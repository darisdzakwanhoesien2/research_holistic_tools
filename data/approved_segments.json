        "Abstract": "Abstract\n\nThis paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of research on strategic positioning of companies and the measurement of greenwashing in sustainability reporting. Its main aim is to synthesize and organize the existing literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies. Drawing on a rigorous content analysis of 88 studies, we delineate strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and examine content-analysis-based measurement approaches used to detect it. Our SLR shows that most strategic typologies draw on theories such as legitimacy theory, impression management theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory. Several studies adopt a four-quadrant matrix with varying conceptual dimensions, while others classify strategic responses to institutional pressures along a passive-active continuum. However, the evidence suggests that to assume that companies uniformly pursue sustainability reporting strategies is a major oversimplification. The findings also indicate that the literature proposes a variety of innovative, content-analysis-based approaches aimed at capturing divergences between communicative claims and organizational realities\u2014most notably, discrepancies between disclosure and measurable performance, and between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions, as well as the identification of selective or manipulative communication practices that may signal greenwashing. Analytical techniques commonly focus on linguistic and visual cues in sustainability reports, including tone (sentiment and narrative framing), readability (both traditional readability indices and machine learning-based textual complexity measures), and visual content (selective emphasis, imagery framing, and graphic distortions). We also synthesize studies that document empirically verified instances of greenwashing and contrast them with research that, in our view, relies on overly simplified or untested assumptions. Based on this SLR, we identify central theoretical and methodological priorities for advancing the study of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and propose a research agenda to guide future research.\n\nKeywords: sustainability reporting; corporate greenwashing; greenwashing measurement; measurement approaches; strategic typologies; systematic literature review\n\n# 1.",
        "Introduction": "Introduction\n\nThe concept of greenwashing began to gain wider attention in the late 1990s, with scholarly and public interest in the issue continuing to grow over the following decades [1]. Although research on this phenomenon has expanded significantly, the concept still lacks a\n\nCheck for updates\n\nAcademic Editor: Silvia Angeloni\n\nReceived: 6 November 2025\n\nRevised: 4 December 2025\n\nAccepted: 12 December 2025\n\nPublished: 19 December 2025\n\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 by the authors.\n\nLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThis article is an open access article\n\ndistributed under the terms and\n\nconditions of the Creative Commons\n\nAttribution (CC BY) license.\n\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nsingle, universally accepted definition, and its interpretation remains open to debate [2]. It was originally applied to environmental issues and defined as \u201cthe intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance\u201d [3]. It was also referred to as \u201csymbolic corporate environmentalism\u201d [4]. Subsequently, the concept evolved into a broader interpretation, described as the \u201cselective disclosure of positive information about a company's environmental or social performance without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image\u201d [5] or the \u201cact of presenting a company's environmental and/or social performance in a misleading way\u201d [6]. Following the triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability and the principles of environmental integrity, social equity, and economic prosperity, addressing environmental, social, and economic issues has become essential to discussions of greenwashing [2].\n\nGreenwashing has been analyzed from various perspectives, with the literature presenting different conceptualizations of its relationship to similar notions. Some authors interpret it as a form of decoupling [7], highlighting the discrepancy between dissemination of symbolic statements (\u201ctalk\u201d) and actual actions (\u201cwalk\u201d) [8]. Others view greenwashing as a concept that describes decoupling processes within the context of sustainability, treating greenwashing and decoupling as synonyms [9,10,11]. Yet, Siano et al. [12] distinguish between two primary types of greenwashing: decoupling and attention deflection. In this context, decoupling refers to the gap between disclosure and performance [13] or between policy statements and actual corporate commitment [14], as well as the disconnection between means and ends [15]. It also includes impression management practices that involve \u201cempty green claims and policies\u201d and \u201csin of fibbing\u201d, in which companies make claims that are outright false [16]. Impression management encompasses emphasizing positive organizational outcomes (enhancement) or obfuscating negative organizational outcomes (concealment) [17].\n\nAttention deflection, as the act of concealing unethical business practices, encompasses various deceptive communication tactics, such as selective and inaccurate disclosure [5], including incomplete comparisons and vague or irrelevant statements [18]. It also involves misleading written texts and visual imagery [19] as well as unverifiable claims, such as implied superiority and the \u201csin of no proof\u201d, where assertions lack substantiating evidence or accessible supporting information [20].\n\nGreenwashing involves both the overstatement of positive performance and the concealment of negative information [21,22]. It encompasses a broad range of practices commonly characterized by the dissemination of misleading information [23], including various forms of false claims rooted in hypocrisy and/or deception [24]. Some authors connect greenwashing with the obfuscation of negative sustainability information, suggesting that companies with inferior sustainability performance use complex, ambiguous language to produce intentionally opaque or confusing reports [25]. This means that greenwashing can be identified through linguistic patterns, which often rely on overly optimistic terms that emphasize positive aspects. Accordingly, the literature on greenwashing is closely related to research on selective disclosure, in which favorable information is emphasized while unfavorable details are minimized or omitted [26].\n\nIn this paper, we refer to greenwashing in sustainability reporting as the deliberate or unintended dissemination of misleading, incomplete, or overly favorable sustainability-related disclosures. It is manifested through the selective presentation of positive information, the concealment or obfuscation of negative performance, or the decoupling of reported claims from underlying organizational practices. This process constructs an unjustifiably positive impression of corporate sustainability by overstating positive actions and concealing negative ones.\nThe complex and often ambiguous nature of greenwashing presents substantial methodological challenges for researchers attempting to identify and measure it. At the same time, these challenges offer valuable opportunities for future inquiry [27]. However, there remains a limited understanding regarding the strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and the approaches used to measure it, including their operationalization, methodologies, and data sources applied in this field [28]. In particular, approaches based on content analysis are especially valuable and offer significant conceptual and empirical insights, given that much of the existing research on greenwashing relies on indicators derived from secondary sources such as dedicated databases and specific ratings, which are not always transparent, are often binary, and may be arbitrary or highly autocorrelated. In fact, using composite ESG indicators derived from secondary sources typically provides only aggregated scores, obscuring which aspect of greenwashing is measured, reducing comparability across heterogeneous providers, and limiting replicability where access to commercial ESG databases is restricted [29,30,31].\n\nGrowing scholarly interest in greenwashing has resulted in the publication of several systematic literature reviews [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39] and bibliometric analyses that characterize the structure and trends in this scientific field [40,41,42,43]. Nonetheless, systematic literature reviews focusing specifically on the measurement of greenwashing [32] and greenwashing in sustainability reporting [44,45] remain scarce. This scarcity is particularly evident in relation to strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and to measurement approaches grounded in content-analysis studies.\n\nGiven these challenges and the rapidly expanding research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting, it is crucial to build on existing analyses to address persistent gaps and explore under-researched areas.\n\nThe main aim of this paper, therefore, is to systematically organize and synthesize the current literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies in this field. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive syntheses to date of strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and provide an integrated, conceptually grounded overview of existing approaches and analytical techniques used to measure and detect greenwashing through content analysis. In particular, our systematic literature review aims to address the following research questions, which have not been sufficiently explored in existing research:What strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting have been identified in the literature?What content analysis--based measurement approaches are used to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting?\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the research methodology. In Section 3, the results are presented and discussed. Section 4 identifies areas for future research and Section 5 provides concluding remarks and acknowledges the study's limitations.\n\n## 2.",
        "Materials and Methods": "Materials and Methods\n\nWe conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. As a rigorous and structured research method, an SLR facilitates a comprehensive examination of scholarly works within a specific research domain. This approach enables the mapping and synthesis of existing knowledge while providing insight into the interconnections among studies. Furthermore, it supports the identification, classification, and critical evaluation of the current body of literature, thereby establishing a foundation for recognizing research gaps and proposing future research directions [28,35,46,47].\nThe SLR presented in this study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines [48]. The review utilized the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection databases, selected for their reliability, relevance, and frequent use in systematic reviews [35,49]. In addition, these databases are the most widely used citation indexes in the world, and, consequently, most bibliometric and scientometric tools are based on them [50,51].\n\nTo improve methodological robustness, the selection of search terms was informed by a comprehensive review of previous SLRs and bibliometric analyses on greenwashing [28,35,36,37,39], sustainability reporting [52,53,54,55], and research integrating both topics [45]. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the research field, a thorough search was conducted using keywords that combined terms related to greenwashing and sustainability reporting.\n\nFirst, we created a list of terms describing greenwashing activities, which included the following keywords: \u201cgreenwash\u201d, \u201cgreen wash\u201d, \u201cgreen-wash*\u201d, \u201cdecoupling\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d, \u201cobfuscation\u201d, and \u201cdeceptive\u201d.\n\nSecond, given the diverse terminology used in extensive sustainability reporting research, a detailed search was conducted using keywords such as \u201csustainability report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201csustainable development report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccorporate social responsibility report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cCSR report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cresponsib* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cESG report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccorporate citizenship report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ctriple bottom line report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cTBL report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGRI report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGlobal Reporting Initiative report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201csustainable development goal* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cSDG* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cintegr* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cnon-financ* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cenvironm* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cgreen report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGHG report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cgreenhouse gas report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccarbon report*/disclosure\u201d, and \u201csocial report*/disclosure\u201d.\n\nThe list of query words and the combined query string used in this study are provided in Table A1 and Table A2 in the Appendix A.\n\nNext, we defined the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review (Table A3 in the Appendix A). A study was considered eligible if the publication explicitly addressed the phenomenon of greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting as a primary research topic. In addition, the study had to discuss greenwashing strategies or methods for measuring greenwashing that were grounded in content analysis of sustainability reporting. We also specified that each study must operationalize at least one dimension of greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability reports or other corporate disclosures containing ESG-related information.\n\nFor the exclusion criteria, we omitted publications not written in English, reflecting the dominance of English in scientific communication [56] and reducing language and translation bias [28,57]. We also excluded books, book chapters, editorial materials, meeting abstracts, and data papers, as these document types typically do not undergo a rigorous peer-review process that ensures the reliability and credibility of empirical findings [58]. This approach is standard in many SLRs [28,49]. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table A3 in the Appendix A.\n\nThe search was conducted on 17 February 2025, utilizing the query string detailed in Table A2 in the Appendix A. After applying the initial exclusion criteria outlined in phase 1 (document type and language), 249 publications were identified in Scopus and 199 in WoS, resulting in a combined total of 448 records. Following the removal of 174 duplicate records from the two databases, the final dataset consisted of 274 unique publications. To organize key information throughout the process and to facilitate the identification and elimination of duplicates, we used a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\n\nIn the subsequent screening stage, the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the 274 publications were reviewed by two researchers (the co-authors) to assess their relevance to the\nstudy's objectives and determine eligibility for further analysis and data extraction. Each researcher independently screened all 274 publications to evaluate whether greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting constituted the primary focus of the article. They also assessed whether the study involved an empirical examination of greenwashing in corporate reporting in line with the predefined scope of the review. Based on these criteria, each publication was classified as either \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cexclude.\u201d In cases where a researcher\u2014after reviewing the title, keywords, and abstract\u2014was uncertain about whether a publication met the inclusion criteria, it was conservatively classified as \u201cinclude\u201d and was retained for full-text assessment in the next stage. To evaluate inter-rater (inter-coder) reliability for the binary inclusion/exclusion decision, the reviewers' assessments were compared and Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient was high (\u03ba = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78--0.91), indicating strong agreement between the two reviewers [59,60]. In cases where discrepancies between the researchers' decisions occurred, the publication was retained for full-text review in the next stage. As a result of this phase, 182 publications were retained for the research sample, while 92 were excluded as not relevant to the review's objectives. Full texts were subsequently retrieved for the 182 included studies. Only 4 publications could not be obtained. Additionally, 21 publications were identified through the snowballing method.\n\nIn the next stage, 178 publications identified through database searches and 21 additional publications identified via snowball sampling were subjected to in-depth full-text analysis. The same two researchers independently reviewed the full texts, applying inclusion criteria derived directly from the research questions: (1) the article discussed greenwashing strategies in the context of sustainability reporting as a central topic, or (2) the study presented and empirically applied at least one content-analysis-based approach to measuring greenwashing. Publications were excluded if greenwashing strategies or measurement approaches were addressed only tangentially, if no methods or approaches based on content analysis of sustainability reports or other ESG-related disclosures were presented or applied, or if all dimensions of greenwashing were operationalized exclusively through external ESG scores from global financial or non-financial data vendors. Inter-coder decisions were again compared, and Cohen's kappa was recalculated. Agreement for full-text eligibility reached 88% (95% CI: 0.81--0.95), indicating an almost perfect level of agreement [59,60]. In cases of disagreement, both researchers re-examined the publication, discussed their assessments, and reached a joint decision. Following this process, 88 publications were retained for further analysis (76 identified through database searches and 12 identified via snowball sampling).\n\nTo provide a clearer understanding of the process of searching and including publications in this review, the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.\n\nIn the final step of the SLR, a thematic content analysis was conducted to extract and synthesize data relevant to the research questions. A narrative synthesis approach was applied, combining systematic textual summarization with interpretive analysis of the findings, as appropriate given the objectives of this review [61,62]. Two researchers independently reviewed and coded the full texts of all publications to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. A combined deductive--inductive coding strategy was used. At the deductive level, the coding framework was structured around two main thematic groups of studies, corresponding to the research questions: (1) articles addressing strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and (2) articles presenting and applying content-analysis-based approaches and analytical techniques for measuring greenwashing.\n\nWithin each thematic group, additional codes were developed inductively to capture recurring concepts and patterns emerging from the material. For studies classified in the first group (strategic typologies), we coded the following elements: authorship,\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nthe theoretical framework(s) used, research sample characteristics, and the characteristics of strategic approaches. For studies classified in the second group (measurement approaches), we coded the following elements: authorship, the measurement approach or analytical technique used, research sample characteristics, the type of data, the method of data acquisition, and the sustainability focus of the measurement (environmental, social, and/or governance).\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1.

Detailed characteristics of the studies included in the SLR are provided in Table A4 and Table A5 in the Appendix A.

        "Results and Discussion": "Results and Discussion\n\nThis section presents the main findings of the SLR on greenwashing in sustainability reporting. It synthesizes key strategic typologies, content-analysis--based measurement approaches, and analytical techniques used to identify greenwashing. By integrating theoretical, methodological, and empirical insights, the section elucidates how greenwashing has been conceptualized, operationalized, and evidenced across the extant literature.\n\n### 3.1. Strategic Typologies of Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting\n\nResearch on strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting primarily draws on legitimacy theory, impression management theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory.\n\nMost existing typologies are structured around a four-quadrant matrix but differ in the dimensions considered. Amores-Salvad\u00f3 et al. [63] developed a model of four distinct strategic positions by comparing environmental performance and disclosure relative to industry averages. They identify two coherent approaches\u2014green leaders and blackbirds\u2014and two incoherent ones: green quiets (representing brownwashing) and green parrots (indicative of greenwashing). Kurpierz and Smith [64] refined Delmas and Burbano's [3] greenwashing typology by focusing on the truthfulness of claims (true/false) and their consequences (harm/no harm), thereby deconstructing greenwashing into a harm/no-harm dichotomy that differentiates between fraudulent practices and \u201ccheap talk.\u201d Cooper and Wang [65] analyzed the relationship between reported policy and activities addressing refugee needs. They categorized corporations into four types\u2014reactionary,\nrecurring, relevant, and revelatory\u2014based on the consistency of refugee programming over time and the degree of alignment between programs, policies, and impacts.\n\nIn another approach, strategic responses to institutional influences in sustainability reporting have been classified along a continuum from passive to active. Acquiescence represents the most passive strategy, manipulation the most active, while compromise, avoidance, and defiance fall in between [66].\n\nVarious typologies are derived from impression management theory. Talbot and Barbat [67] identified four impression management strategies in mining companies' CSR reports aimed at neutralizing and obscuring negative information on water performance. These include two data manipulation strategies\u2014strategic omission and obfuscation\u2014used to conceal noncompliance and poor performance, and two defensive strategies\u2014minimizing environmental impact and relativizing poor environmental performance\u2014employed to legitimize negative aspects. Leung and Snell [68] found that gambling companies use five camouflaging-based disclosure strategies\u2014zero disclosure, curtailment, disclamation, defensive fa\u00e7ades, and assertive fa\u00e7ades\u2014involving impression management to selectively maintain moral legitimacy amid shifting institutional expectations. Drawing on an analysis of communication strategies employed by Spanish listed companies regarding the SDGs, Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. [69] revealed the use of legitimization strategy alongside proactive and defensive impression management approaches. The proactive approach focused on congratulation, self-promotion, and organizational promotion, while the defensive approach addressed negative situations through excuses, justifications, and apologies.\n\nIn the context of signaling theory and legitimization strategies, Hahn and L\u00fclfs [70], drawing on the concepts of symbolic and substantive management of legitimacy, identified six specific strategies for disclosing negative aspects in sustainability reports: marginalization, abstraction, indication of facts, rationalization (instrumental and theoretical), authorization, and corrective action (type 1 and type 2). Saber and Weber [71] subsequently applied the same framework and typology. Yuan et al. [72] identified three distinct greenwashing strategies: exaggerating, referring to the gap between actual performance and disclosure; distracting, highlighting the gap between strengths and concerns; and window-dressing, addressing the gap between materiality and immateriality. Leung and Snell [73] further revealed that companies in controversial industries, such as gambling, often engage in symbolic manipulation rather than substantive CSR, aiming to alter perceptions of corporate identity by emphasizing pragmatic legitimacy, diverting attention from moral legitimacy issues, and manipulating cognitive symbols. Finally, Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero et al. [74] found that companies with superior CSR performance tend to use high-quality CSR reporting to highlight achievements (enhancement strategy), offering more comparable and reliable information. In contrast, companies with poorer CSR performance often employ low-quality reporting to obscure actual performance (obfuscation strategy), providing information that is less balanced, accurate, and clear.\n\nWhile some researchers emphasize the exaggerated optimism in sustainability communications, others focus on the defensive strategies employed by companies. Laskin and Mikhailovna Nesova [26] demonstrated that sustainability reports are characterized by pronounced optimism, as they employ a higher frequency of positively charged linguistic elements\u2014such as praise, satisfaction, and inspiration\u2014while reducing the use of negatively charged expressions such as blame, hardship, and denial. Megura and Gunderson [75] identified subtle forms of climate change denial in the sustainability reports of fossil fuel companies, manifested as ideological denialism, greenwashing, and reification. Moreover, they observed various forms of greenwashing used to manipulate stakeholder perceptions within climate-related narratives, including techno-optimism, compliance,\ncountermeasures, and omission. Laufer [76] argued that companies use defensive strategies to protect themselves from liability, both internally and externally, with greenwashing relying on three key elements of deception: confusion, fronting, and posturing. Companies sometimes engage in strategic silence, with sustainability reports omitting concrete strategies for managing or curbing overproduction\u2014a form of vagueness recognized as a signal of greenwashing [77]. Research by Roszkowska-Menkes et al. [9] identified the selective disclosure of negative events in sustainability reporting, manifested in three forms: vague disclosure, avoidance, and hypocrisy. In addition, Gentile and Gupta [78] identified several strategies adopted by leading global fossil fuel companies, including necessitarianism; greenwashing, manifested through claims of sustainability, strategic wording, overstated commitments, half-truths, the use of \u2018net-zero' as a marketing label, and avoidance of critical issues (\u2018the elephant in the room'); strategic blame placement; and techno-optimism.\n\nConsidering how visual elements can be leveraged to influence CSR reports, Friedel [79] emphasized the strategic use of images and text and their impact on the perceived objectivity and construction of truth, highlighting how corporate myths are created and maintained to enhance organizational legitimacy. Additionally, Cho et al. [80] and C\u00fcre et al. [81] investigated corporate manipulation of graphs in sustainability reporting and identified two impression management strategies\u2014enhancement and obfuscation\u2014evidenced by the selective presentation of graphical data emphasizing favorable trends and the inclusion of material distortions within the graphs.\n\nResearch shows that to assume that companies adopt uniform sustainability reporting strategies is a significant oversimplification. Moreover, ESG practices are driven by diverse motivations, including strategic, altruistic, and greenwashing-related incentives [82]. Schons and Steinmeier [10] argue that companies can adopt strategies that combine symbolic and substantive CSR actions. This means that some of them may choose not to engage in CSR at all\u2014either symbolically or substantively\u2014and then they are referred to as Neglectors. Other companies may decide to focus primarily on symbolic actions (Greenwashers), who follow a \u201cmere talk\u201d strategy, or on substantive actions (Silent Saints), who adopt a \u201cmere walk\u201d strategy. Finally, some companies may demonstrate high levels of both symbolic and substantive engagement, acting as Balanced Engagers who \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. Siano et al. [12] argued that the simple distinction between talk and action is insufficient. Following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, they expanded the greenwashing taxonomy\u2014originally encompassing decoupling and attention deflection\u2014by identifying a new form of irresponsible behavior, namely \u201cdeceptive manipulation,\u201d in which sustainability communication is deliberately used to manipulate actual business practices. Furthermore, Cho et al. [83] argued that more diverse and nuanced theoretical perspectives are needed to understand sustainability reporting, as conflicting societal and institutional pressures can force companies to engage in organizational hypocrisy by creating and maintaining discrepant fa\u00e7ades, such as rational, progressive, and reputational.\n\nConsidering research on strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting, most studies in this domain can be viewed as extending or complementing one another rather than offering contradictory insights. Apparent inconsistencies typically stem from scholars examining different dimensions of greenwashing\u2014for instance, exaggerated optimism versus subtle forms of denial, or text-based versus visual communication strategies. Moreover, the literature has evolved from simple 2 \u00d7 2 typologies toward more sophisticated frameworks that either position strategic responses to institutional pressures along a passive--active continuum or conceptualize varying forms and degrees of obfuscation or deception.\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nTable 1 summarizes the strategic approaches and conceptual positions of greenwashing identified in sustainability reporting. A detailed description of the underlying studies is provided in Table A4 in the Appendix A.\n\nTable 1.

Disclosure-Performance Gap Approach\n\nOne of the main approaches used to measure greenwashing in sustainability reporting focuses on the discrepancy between sustainability disclosure (D) and actual sustainability performance (P). Within this framework, researchers quantify ESG disclosure (i.e., what companies communicate about their sustainability actions) separately from ESG performance (i.e., what companies actually achieve). Greenwashing is thus conceptualized as the difference, imbalance, or misalignment between these two constructs. This approach builds on the \"talk-walk gap\" perspective, which assumes that companies may deliberately overstate their sustainability commitments when actual performance fails to support the communicated narrative.\n\nIn accordance with the inclusion criteria adopted in this review, the analyzed sample consists exclusively of studies in which at least one component of greenwashing measurement\u2014disclosure and/or performance\u2014is derived from content analysis of sustainability-related reports. While content analysis is most frequently applied to capture the scope and characteristics of sustainability disclosure [1,11,23,84-94], the sample also includes studies in which both disclosure and performance measures are extracted from sustainability report content and subsequently coded using predefined analytical schemes [95-99].\n\nVarious methods have been employed to quantify sustainability disclosure. The most prevalent approach involves counting the frequency of environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) keywords and normalizing these counts by the total word count of sustainability reports [23,84,88]. Some studies further refined this approach by weighting ESG terminology according to its contextual relevance or importance [86,97-99], or by assigning differentiated weights to monetary, quantitative, and purely narrative statements\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nto assess disclosure precision, with financial data considered the most credible form of evidence [1]. Some studies have used advanced natural language processing techniques to quantify ESG disclosures, combining content extraction with sentiment analysis [87,91,92,93,94].\n\nBeyond quantitative text metrics or sentiment indicators, several studies operationalized disclosure through checklist-based assessments, identifying the presence or absence of specific sustainability elements, typically coded in binary form [11,85,89,90,95,96]. In addition, environmental disclosure has also been quantified using self-reported environmental data submitted to external registries, treating reported quantities as indicators of environmental transparency [7,100].\n\nIn the reviewed studies, sustainability performance was most frequently quantified using external ESG scores provided by established global financial and non-financial data vendors, including Bloomberg [1,85,91], Refinitiv (now LSEG Data) [23], MSCI KLD STAT [11,93], CNRDS [88,92], HEXUN-RKS [90,94] and KOSPI200 [86]. Lagasio [87] also employed a normalized ESG score to assess greenwashing, although the data source for this metric was not explicitly specified. In several studies, environmental performance indicators were obtained directly from external operational data registries, most commonly from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported to regulatory authorities and environmental agencies [7,89,100].\n\nIn the remaining group of studies, ESG performance was derived through content analysis of sustainability reports. These studies constructed checklist-based assessments of indicators aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework or specific ESG actions. Quantitatively verified practices were distinguished from qualitative descriptions, with greater weight assigned to evidence supported by measurable or verifiable data [84,95,96,97,98,99].\n\nAn overview of methods used to operationalize ESG disclosures and performances is presented in Table 2.\n\nIn the analyzed studies, greenwashing is primarily conceptualized as the discrepancy between companies' communicated sustainability claims and their actual sustainability performance. Accordingly, empirical measurement typically relies on discrepancy-based indicators, expressed either as the difference between ESG disclosure levels and ESG performance levels [1,88,90] or as the ratio of disclosed ESG items to implemented sustainability actions [23].\n\nMore advanced studies develop customized indicators that integrate cognitive and linguistic dimensions of sustainability communication. For instance, Kim et al. [86] define greenwashing as the difference between text-weighted ESG disclosure scores\u2014which capture the depth and materiality of sustainability language\u2014and ESG performance. Kim and Lyon [7] measure greenwashing as the deviation between declared and actual emission reductions, normalized by declared reduction levels to control for firm-size effects. Similarly, Lagasio [87] constructs an \u201cESG-washing\u201d metric by subtracting standardized sustainability performance scores from sentiment-based ESG disclosure indices. Lee and Raschke [23] compute the ratio of textual ESG performance communication to standardized Refinitiv ESG scores to capture the communicative exaggeration of performance. Li et al. [96] likewise calculate greenwashing as the discrepancy between standardized indices of green communication (GCI) and green practices (GPI), reflecting overstated communication relative to actual initiatives. Finally, Zhou and Chen [97] and Zhou et al. [98,99] operationalize greenwashing as the standardized disparity between weighted textual disclosure indices and quantified environmental performance indicators, offering a multidimensional representation of disclosure--performance misalignment.\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nTable 2.

[99]  |\n\nIn summary, methods for measuring greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability disclosures and performance consistently draw on the notion of the \"talk-walk gap,\" but operationalize it in different ways, thus yielding different analytical insights. Checklist-based indices provide transparency and close alignment with reporting standards but are highly labor-intensive and limited in scalability. Keyword-frequency approaches offer strong scalability but primarily measure the volume of ESG communication, which can lead to inflated perceptions of disclosure quality. More advanced approaches\u2014such as quality-weighted metrics, sentiment analysis, and broader NLP techniques\u2014more effectively capture discrepancies between communication and actual performance, but they require specialized tools and expertise, and their outputs may diverge from those produced by simpler measures. On the performance side, ESG ratings, hard ESG indicators, and checklist-based indices capture distinct facets of sustainability, resulting in varying assessments of the same companies. ESG ratings face additional challenges due to methodological opacity, dependence on corporate disclosures, and inconsistency across providers. Overall, the evidence suggests that disclosure and performance measures should be viewed as complementary: differences between them reflect the multidimensional nature of greenwashing rather than measurement error.\n\n# 3.2.2. Symbolic and Substantive Disclosure Approach\n\nThe second methodological approach conceptualizes greenwashing as the distinction between symbolic and substantive sustainability disclosures, determined by the credibility, specificity, and verifiability of the information provided. Within this framework, it is assumed that companies may use sustainability rhetoric as a means of gaining legitimacy by emphasizing broad commitments or aspirational claims that are not substantiated by verifiable actions, measurable outcomes, or tangible resource allocations. Consequently,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\ncontent analysis of sustainability reports is used to identify the nature of corporate sustainability activities, classify them as symbolic or substantive, and assess the potential imbalance between these two dimensions in sustainability reporting. From this perspective, greenwashing is operationalized as a predominance of symbolic content over substantive information [101,102,103]. However, it should be emphasized that symbolic communication should not, in all contexts, be treated as synonymous with greenwashing. It constitutes greenwashing only when it systematically substitutes for or obscures substantive information, rather than when it coexists with reliable, performance-based disclosure [6,30,103,104].\n\nSymbolic actions (often referred to as green talk) occur when a company makes claims or discloses information about social or environmental initiatives that are not actually implemented in practice [24]. Such symbolic disclosures tend to be broad, predominantly positive, and typically lack measurable evidence or verifiable outcomes. In contrast, substantive actions (green walk) refer to disclosures describing initiatives that have been materially implemented and have produced tangible, verifiable impacts. In other words, whenever a company provides detailed and evidence-based information about a specific action, or when the accuracy of its claims can be verified, the disclosure is considered substantive [24].\n\nAlthough the symbolic--substantive distinction is the most widely used conceptualization in the literature, several authors employ alternative terminology to describe comparable phenomena. For example, Khan et al. [104] differentiate between cosmetic and organic efforts, where cosmetic efforts rely on rhetorical strategies and attention-grabbing narratives that superficially frame positive environmental performance, whereas organic actions reflect credible and meaningful initiatives supported by concrete evidence. Xing et al. [102] distinguish between soft and hard sustainability disclosures, with soft disclosures referring to claims without strong objective evidence, typically compiled by companies themselves, and hard disclosures based on quantitative data that can be verified by other institutions. Despite the different terminology, these studies share a common assumption: symbolic communication reflects declarative or aspirational expressions of commitment, while substantive actions provide verifiable evidence of actual progress towards sustainability.\n\nOur SLR revealed that most authors applied checklist-based classification schemes to distinguish between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions. This method relies on predefined lists of sustainability-related issues or actions, where each disclosed item is coded as symbolic or substantive depending on its level of detail, quantification, and verifiability. For example, Xing et al. [102] developed a checklist consisting of 16 soft and 79 hard disclosure items, representing narrative versus evidence-based information. Khan et al. [104] constructed a checklist of 14 items assessing the reliability (organic actions) and relevance (cosmetic actions) of information presented in sustainability reports. Li et al. [101] identified 8 elements characterizing symbolic actions and 6 describing substantive ones. Van der Ploeg and Vanclay [6] employed a ten-question checklist to assess whether reports provided balanced information, including negative environmental impacts, arguing that a high proportion of descriptive over data-supported disclosures indicates potential symbolic legitimation strategies. Zhang et al. [105] proposed a checklist of 19 environmental disclosure items, specifying criteria for classifying each disclosure or corporate activity as symbolic or substantive. Subsequently, Zhang et al. [106] expanded this framework to 22 indicators, while Zhang et al. [107] further incorporated additional evidence such as certifications and quantified environmental achievements. Similarly, Xu et al. [103] applied a 17-item checklist addressing the readability, reliability, and completeness of sustainability disclosures, defining explicit criteria for categorizing statements as symbolic or substantive.\n\nA slightly different approach to classifying corporate sustainability actions as symbolic or substantive was proposed by Costa et al. [108]. The authors employed the Global\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nReporting Initiative (GRI) framework to identify and categorize disclosure indicators. Based on these standards, they developed a checklist of GRI indicators and subsequently evaluated each disclosure item in sustainability reports to determine whether it was presented in a narrative (symbolic) form or as verifiable quantitative or performance-based (substantive) information.\n\nIn several studies, a linguistic-textual classification was applied to distinguish between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions. For example, Khalil and O'Sullivan [24] differentiated between the two by examining the linguistic structure of ESG narratives, including the number of sentences and words related to environmental and social topics, under the assumption that a higher proportion of symbolic expressions indicates a greater likelihood of greenwashing. Similarly, Huq and Carling [30] utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify the number of substantive greenhouse gas (GHG) disclosures included in sustainability reports, interpreting a low proportion of evidence-based statements as indicative of symbolic reporting and potential greenwashing.\n\nAn overview of methods used for operationalizing greenwashing in sustainability reporting based on symbolic and substantive dimensions is presented in Table 3.\n\nTable 3. Methods for Operationalizing Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Based on Symbolic and Substantive Dimensions.\n\n|  Type of Method | Author  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Checklist-based manual classification | Khan et al. [104]; Li et al. [101]; Van der Ploeg and Vanclay [6]; Xing et al. [102]; Xu et al. [103]; Zhang et al. [105]; Zhang et al. [106]; Zhang et al. [107]  |\n|  GRI-indicator-based classification | Costa et al. [108]  |\n|  Linguistic-textual classification | Huq and Carling [30]; Khalil and O'sullivan [24]  |\n\nOur analysis indicates that, within this group of studies, greenwashing was most frequently quantified as the discrepancy between symbolic and substantive sustainability disclosures [101,102,105,108] or as the ratio of symbolic to substantive elements in sustainability reporting [103,106,107]. Some researchers examined this phenomenon indirectly through disclosure quality indicators, where a greater emphasis on relevance (cosmetic efforts) relative to reliability (organic efforts) was interpreted as indicative of symbolic reporting and potential greenwashing [104]. Other studies identified greenwashing through the dominance of symbolic disclosures over substantive ones [24,30], or by observing a prevalence of declarative statements (symbolic actions) over verifiable data (substantive actions) [6]. Collectively, these findings suggest that symbolic sustainability communication not supported by verifiable progress may serve as a deliberate impression management strategy, representing greenwashing in corporate sustainability reporting.\n\nAlthough all methods aim to detect the gap between symbolic and substantive disclosures, they operationalize this gap differently. Manual approaches provide detailed, context-sensitive assessments but are highly time- and resource-intensive. Automated methods (e.g., NLP, text mining) enable large-scale analysis and efficient analysis but may overlook subtle linguistic and contextual nuances. These approaches are therefore best seen as complementary: manual coding can be used to train and validate automated tools, thereby combining interpretive accuracy with computational scale. The optimal method ultimately depends on research objectives and resource constraints\u2014automated techniques are well suited for large cross-sectional studies, whereas manual checklists are preferable for in-depth analyses of individual reports or small samples.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\n# 3.2.3. Selective and Manipulative Disclosure Approach\n\nA third approach to measuring greenwashing in sustainability reporting focuses on how companies present ESG-related information. Within this research stream, greenwashing is operationalized through the detection of selective disclosures and expressive manipulation of the content of sustainability reports. Selective disclosure is defined as a company intentionally emphasizing positive ESG achievements while omitting or downplaying negative aspects of its operations [109-114]. Expressive manipulation, on the other hand, involves using a promotional tone, emotional language, or biased narrative to influence stakeholder perceptions and create a favorable, yet potentially misleading, impression of the company's actual ESG activities and performance [111,112].\n\nOur SLR revealed that selective disclosure and expressive manipulation were most commonly identified using checklist-based manual coding, in which ESG topics were classified as disclosed or omitted and further distinguished as symbolic or substantive. In these studies, selective disclosure was typically measured as the proportion of omitted ESG items relative to the total number of expected disclosures, while expressive manipulation was quantified as the ratio of symbolically disclosed items to all disclosed items [106,107] or as the ratio of symbolic to substantive disclosure elements [115]. The overall greenwashing level was often computed as the geometric mean of the selective disclosure and expressive manipulation levels [115-117].\n\nOther researchers applied rubric-based coding frameworks, using author-designed diagnostic questions [109] or custom indicators [118] specifically developed to detect narrative exaggeration, unverifiable claims, and selective omission of sustainability information.\n\nAnother method for detecting greenwashing applies GRI-indicator-based manual coding, in which disclosures are classified as \"good news,\" \"neutral news,\" or \"bad news,\" and companies are subsequently evaluated on whether they systematically downplay or omit unfavorable information while emphasizing positive disclosures [110].\n\nSelective disclosure and expressive manipulation have also been examined using linguistic-textual methods. These methods relied on keyword frequency analysis and sentiment analysis to detect inflated positive language and patterns of symbolic communication [112,113]. They also combined lexicon-based techniques with stylistic and syntactic coding to capture narrative tone and discursive bias [111]. Finally, Yu et al. [114] applied a computational similarity-based method, demonstrating that templated sustainability statements with high textual similarity scores indicate generic and repetitive disclosure practices intended to obscure substantive performance.\n\nAn overview of methods used for operationalizing greenwashing in sustainability reporting based on selective and manipulative disclosure is presented in Table 4.\n\nTable 4. Methods for Operationalizing Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting based on Selective and Manipulative Disclosure.\n\n|  Type of Method | Author  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Checklist-based manual coding | Cao et al.

[112]  |\n\nIn summary, selective and manipulative measurement approaches share a common conceptualization of greenwashing\u2014emphasizing positive information while omitting negative information\u2014but differ in how they quantify the phenomenon and in their sensitivity to detecting it. Checklist-based methods offer transparent assessments of selective\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\ndisclosure and symbolic claims but are difficult to scale. Linguistic and NLP-based methods capture rhetorical cues such as tone, readability, and narrative patterns, though their accuracy depends on model quality and may produce results that diverge from checklist-based evaluations. Consequently, the literature increasingly views these methods as complementary: measuring both what is disclosed and how it is disclosed provides distinct yet mutually reinforcing insights into the multidimensional nature of greenwashing.\n\n### 3.3. Analytical Techniques for Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Using Content Analysis\n\n### 3.3.1. Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Through Tone Analysis\n\nAn expanding line of research examines how the tone of sustainability reporting\u2014captured through linguistic and sentiment cues\u2014functions as a proxy for detecting greenwashing.\n\nBased on Diction 6.0, Fisher et al. [119] analyzed six forms of tone\u2014positivity, activity, optimism, certainty, realism, and commonality\u2014as potential measures of obfuscation in corporate narratives. However, they found no evidence that tone was used for obfuscation; instead, they observed the opposite effect. In contrast, Esterhuyse and du Toit [120] examined narrative tones (certainty, optimism, activity, realism, and commonality) in large multinationals' human rights disclosures using Diction 7.1.3. They found that low-disclosure companies disproportionately relied on an optimistic tone\u2014particularly using terms denoting satisfaction and inspiration\u2014thereby signaling assertive impression management strategies. Drawing on the AFINN dictionary for word-level sentiment classification, Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez [69] also identified the use of impression-management practices in sustainability communication strategies.\n\nAdopting a slightly different approach, Zharfpeykan [110] assessed Australian companies' environmental and social disclosures, ranging from omission to fully quantified reporting of positive, negative, or neutral news, including violation-versus non-violation-related information. The study found that companies tended either to report representatively (balancing favorable and unfavorable items) or to engage in greenwashing by downplaying high-impact negatives while emphasizing less relevant positives. Using standard natural-language processing techniques, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] applied supervised sentiment analysis (positive/neutral/negative) to examine how a CSR report's environmental score\u2014defined as a text-based measure of environmental emphasis\u2014relates to positivity metrics, thereby evaluating two greenwashing mechanisms: decoupling and attention deflection. Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero et al. [74] further demonstrated that companies with the worst CSR performance, when using an obfuscation-based disclosure strategy, provide less balanced reports that emphasize overly optimistic content. In addition, Conrad and Holtbr\u00fcgge [121] showed that decoupling companies use fewer emotional",
        "References": "references, more self-references, and fewer mentions of risk and anxiety, while relying more heavily on masculine-coded language.\n\nSome studies restrict their analysis to counts of positive and negative words, thereby suggesting that an overly optimistic tone may indicate greenwashing [122]. Building on Huang et al. [123], Hamza and Jarboui [124] employed a more elaborate method, assessing tone management in French companies' sustainability reports by counting positive and negative terms using the French version of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionary. They decomposed tone into a normal component, reflecting neutral descriptions, and an abnormal component, indicating the strategic use of tone management to inform or mislead stakeholders. Liao et al. [125] adopted a similar approach, analyzing the net positive tone of ESG reports (based on positive and negative dictionary of Tsinghua University) by Chinese listed companies and arguing that companies that \u201ctalk more and work less\u201d engage in tone management\u2014i.e. greenwashing. Liang and Wu [126] also applied this approach, using the \u201cBag of Words\u201d method and textual analysis of CSR reports from Chinese listed\ncompanies, and suggested that companies may engage in greenwashing through the use of an abnormally positive tone in their CSR disclosures.\n\nAn alternative approach was proposed by Chen and Ma [91], who used the Term Frequency--Inverse Document Frequency algorithm and derived an \u201cESG greenwashing tone\u201d from the frequencies of positive and negative emotion words and assessed greenwashing as the discrepancy between that tone and the firms' ESG performance. Chen et al. [92] similarly computed decoupling as the difference between an ESG report's optimistic tone\u2014estimated using the Loughran--McDonald lexicon\u2014and actual ESG performance, with both quantities standardized to z-scores, such that larger values indicate greater decoupling. A similar approach was employed by Sauerwald and Su [93] and Zhang [94], who linked the optimistic tone of CSR-reports to corporate social performance; however, Zhang [94] cautioned that relying on the tone--performance gap as a proxy for CSR decoupling has notable limitations.\n\n### 3.3.2. Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Through Readability Analysis\n\nReadability analysis of sustainability reporting aids in detecting greenwashing by examining sentence length, word complexity, jargon use, and overall clarity, which may reveal when complex or technical wording is strategically employed to obscure weak CSR performance. Some studies treat greenwashing and report readability as distinct constructs yet find a significant negative association, indicating that lower readability corresponds to higher levels of greenwashing [127]. However, several studies directly infer greenwashing and obfuscation from the readability metrics in sustainability reports.\n\nLiao et al. [125] suggested that companies engage in greenwashing of ESG reports by \u201ctalking more and doing less,\u201d as evidenced by textual analysis of ESG-related word frequencies relative to overall report length (based on Loughran--McDonald's word list). A study by Esterhuyse and du Toit [120] revealed that low-disclosure companies engaged in obfuscation by reducing report readability, as measured by the Flesch Reading Ease Index, which accounts for average sentence length and syllables per word. Using the same index and based on the Textstat library, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] quantified the readability of CSR reports and interacted it with the environmental score to examine greenwashing mechanisms. In turn, Fabrizio and Kim [128] analyzed voluntary responses to CDP's Climate Change Survey to investigate linguistic obfuscation in environmental disclosures, using the Lingua::EN::Fathom package in Perl and the Gunning Fog Index to measure text complexity based on syllables per word and words per sentence. Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero et al. [74] showed that companies with poor CSR performance employ obfuscation strategies by producing longer, less readable reports containing less accurate and transparent information. They assessed report accuracy and clarity using metrics such as the total number of pages and words, the ratio of numerical characters to total characters and words, and highlighted that \u201csoft\u201d information (text) is more cognitively demanding to process than \u201chard\u201d information (numbers).\n\nSome studies use multiple metrics to assess the readability of sustainability reports. For example, Fisher et al. [119] analyzed corporate accountability disclosures using Flesch Reading Ease as the primary index, complemented by the Flesch--Kincaid, SMOG, and Gunning Fog. Similarly, Nazari et al. [129] applied a comprehensive set of readability and disclosure-size measures\u2014Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch--Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog, Coleman--Liau, SMOG, and the Automated Readability Index\u2014and found that shorter, less readable CSR disclosures were associated with poorer CSR performance, thereby suggesting the presence of greenwashing. Nilipour et al. [130] found that longer sustainability reports tend to have lower readability scores. Drawing on the ReadablePro online readability tool and using five readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau,\nSMOG, and Automated Readability Index), they suggested that information overload and reduced readability may serve to obfuscate negative information. Wang et al. [25] suggested that companies with poor CSR performance may engage in greenwashing by employing complex language to produce vague reports, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse stakeholder reactions. To assess the readability of CSR reports, they applied three indices--Fog, Flesch, and Kincaid--to evaluate the overall difficulty of comprehension.\n\nIn a slightly different approach, Conrad and Holtbr\u00fcgge [121] used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC2015) to analyze morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in sustainability reports, finding that decoupling companies employ less cognitively complex language and exhibit lower linguistic sophistication. Using the same software, Corciolani et al. [131] measured analytical and authentic language in CSR reports and showed that greater involvement in corporate social irresponsibility is associated with more narrative (as opposed to analytical) and more deceptive (as opposed to authentic) language.\n\nIt should also be noted that, using machine learning and text analysis, Pan et al. [132] identified an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental performance feedback and the readability of CSR reports among Chinese SMEs. In this case, readability was operationalized using a word2vec CBOW model trained on CSR reports to predict target words from their surrounding context.\n\n### 3.3.3. Detecting Greenwashing Through Visual Imagery Analysis\n\nConsidering how visual elements can be leveraged to influence sustainability reporting, Friedel [79]\u2014in one of the first studies in this field\u2014argued that the strategic use of imagery in CSR reports, such as depictions of Indigenous bodies and landscapes, was designed to alleviate public concerns about the environmental impacts of fossil fuel production and may represent a distinct form of greenwashing. Hrasky [133] examined the number, size, and types of graphs and photographs related to the three dimensions of sustainability\u2014economic, social, and environmental. The analysis revealed that sustainability-oriented companies used fewer photographs and relied more on quantitative data presented in graphical form within sustainability reports to highlight measurable impacts. In contrast, less sustainable companies pursued symbolic legitimacy, using imagery lacking concrete action as a greenwashing tool in sustainability communication with stakeholders. Cho et al. [80] identified the enhancement strategy by examining whether a significantly larger proportion of graphed items in sustainability reports displayed favorable trends. Additionally, they assessed obfuscation by identifying graphical distortions that presented favorable information, thereby serving as tools for impression management. A similar approach was adopted by C\u00fcre et al. [81] to identify enhancement and obfuscation as impression-management strategies, analyzing graphs with both favorable and unfavorable trends and detecting visual distortions used to manipulate perception.\n\n### 3.3.4. Evidence of Real Greenwashing\n\nWhile the existing greenwashing literature predominantly addresses alleged or theoretical cases, only a small subset examines instances that have been empirically verified.\n\nExamining the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Mobus [134] analyzed BP's pre-crisis CSR disclosures on environmental and safety performance, thematic trends in newspaper coverage during the crisis, and post-crisis findings on contributing conditions, thereby demonstrating the risks of relying on self-reported sources that provide strong incentives to emphasize favorable information while omitting adverse details. Du [135] used the Greenwashing Identification Committee's list\u2014published by South Weekend, one of China's most influential newspapers\u2014to detect greenwashing, thereby demonstrating that this list can serve as an empirical verification tool for confirmed cases. Using content analysis and\ncomparative evaluation of CSR reports against external data on Foxconn, Noronha and Wang [13] identified a disclosure--performance gap attributed to greenwashing. This gap stemmed from selectively highlighting positive aspects while omitting negative social performance details, particularly in cases involving incomplete disclosure and non-compliance with reporting guidelines. Analyzing the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Siano et al. [12] compared the Volkswagen Group's CSR reports with media coverage exposing the \u201cDieselgate\u201d controversy\u2014representing the public revelation of greenwashing\u2014and identified false claims and deliberate manipulation within these reports. Contreras-Pacheco and Claasen [136] identified clear signals of fuzzy reporting as a form of greenwashing. They examined the environmental disaster through events before, during, and following the incident, focusing on the company's disclosure practices, and found that the firm adapted its narrative over time to align with changing stakeholder expectations. In a related vein, Roszkowska-Menkes et al. [9] identified forms of selective disclosure by analyzing companies involved in severe controversies and assessing whether, and to what extent, these controversies and their associated negative events were reported in sustainability disclosures. Corciolani et al. [131], analyzing evidence of negative impacts on human rights, demonstrated how the language of CSR reports can be strategically used to offset companies' involvement in corporate social irresponsibility (CSIR). Finally, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] analyzed how penalized environmental violations influence CSR report readability and sentiment, observing that violating companies tend to adopt a more assertive and overly positive tone while disclosing larger volumes of environmental information\u2014resulting in reports that are more extensive yet less readable.\n\n### 3.3.5. Oversimplified Assumptions of Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting\n\nIn our opinion, some studies are built on assumptions that oversimplify the detection of greenwashing in sustainability reporting.\n\nSome scholars assume that merely issuing CSR reports by companies with poor corporate social performance\u2014or exhibiting a low degree of conformity with the GRI Sustainability Framework and Standards\u2014constitutes evidence of greenwashing, consistent with a symbolic management approach [137]. In this context, Karaman et al. [138] argued that the presence of greenwashing tendencies in the energy sector could be dismissed, as companies with superior CSR performance were more likely to issue CSR reports. Similarly, Koseoglu et al. [139] found that high-performing companies in the hospitality and tourism industry were more likely to publish CSR reports, adopt the GRI framework, and obtain external assurance\u2014thereby providing grounds for rejecting the greenwashing hypothesis in that sector. Mahoney et al. [140] posited\u2014consistent with a signaling theory perspective\u2014that stronger CSR performers issue reports to signal genuine commitment to sustainability, whereas weaker performers use them to project an image of responsibility despite poorer records, thereby engaging in greenwashing. However, it should be noted that none of these three studies employed content-analysis-based methods, which limits their ability to directly assess communicative or linguistic indicators of greenwashing.\n\nTaking into account other studies that, in our view, also oversimplify greenwashing detection in sustainability reporting, Lewis [141] argued that multinational corporations may be accused of greenwashing if they either omit any discussion of their supply chain's environmental impact or report on it only at the level of values and goals, without providing substantive or verifiable details. Additionally, drawing on an assessment of the quality of sustainability disclosures among Australian companies, Zharfpeykan and Akroyd [142] argued that companies tend to adopt greenwashing strategies when the quality of disclosures on material issues either declines or fluctuates\u2014patterns suggesting attempts to obscure weak social and/or environmental performance.\n4.",
        "Directions for Future Research": "Directions for Future Research\n\nOur SLR reveals significant research gaps and unresolved questions that can guide future investigations. While previous studies have provided valuable insights, several areas remain underexplored and warrant more rigorous scholarly attention.\n\nOverall, adopting a mixed-methods approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative techniques is crucial. It enhances methodological rigor, captures the multifaceted nature of greenwashing analysis, and addresses the lack of qualitative depth inherent in purely quantitative designs.\n\nThe analyzed studies indicate that companies may adopt diverse\u2014and often mixed\u2014greenwashing strategies in sustainability reporting, ranging from purely symbolic to substantive actions, or combinations of both. However, existing research frequently over-simplifies these practices, limiting our understanding of how greenwashing manifests across different strategic approaches [10]. Future studies should address this gap by systematically aligning narrative disclosures with verified performance metrics using supervised machine-learning methods, and by employing longitudinal or case-based designs to trace strategic combinations, shifts, and manipulative practices over time. Despite substantial progress in conceptualizing strategic typologies of greenwashing\u2014ranging from distinctions between symbolic and substantive legitimacy management [70] to impression-management frameworks such as enhancement and obfuscation [80,81] or deceptive manipulation [12]\u2014the literature continues to focus predominantly on observable communications and reporting artifacts. It pays less attention to internal organizational processes that generate them. Much of the current understanding derives from textual, visual, or case-based inferences [26,67,74], making it difficult to link specific communicative approaches to concrete decision-making rules within companies. Future research should therefore combine primary data, governance documents, and assurance workpapers to trace how corporate \u201ctalk\u201d is generated, by whom, and for what purposes. It should also aim to develop validated tactic-to-signal dictionaries that connect internal routines with external reporting outcomes. Another notable gap concerns the under-measurement of silence. While existing typologies richly describe what companies disclose\u2014for example, camouflaging strategies in controversial industries [68,73]\u2014they are less effective at identifying greenhushing, or strategic nondisclosure, which often escapes text-based analyses. Studies documenting defensive legitimation and denial frames [75,76] suggest that the boundary between selective speech and deliberate silence is blurred; yet, systematic measures of omission remain scarce. Future research should therefore model disclosure decisions at the margin\u2014examining what is omitted and why\u2014by combining anonymous managerial surveys with gap analyses between internal practices and external reporting. Existing research predominantly focuses on listed companies in developed markets, often within single industries or national contexts [67,68,73], whereas evidence on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies in emerging economies remains limited. Strategic frameworks explicitly distinguish between \u201ctalk\u201d and \u201cwalk\u201d [10] or classify disclosure--performance consistency [63,64,65], highlighting substantial heterogeneity across organizational and institutional contexts. Comparative research designs should therefore investigate how specific constraints\u2014such as reporting costs, liability risk, and supply-chain opacity\u2014influence the selection of disclosure tactics, particularly in sectors where hidden trade-offs are most prevalent. In addition, causal evidence regarding the mechanisms that effectively curb greenwashing remains limited. The existing literature often posits that assurance or regulatory pressure can discipline reporting practices [72]; however, robust empirical tests\u2014particularly those distinguishing between limited and reasonable assurance, or between in-scope and out-of-scope emissions\u2014remain scarce. This includes investigating how greenwashing practices and stakeholder perceptions evolve over time\nand across regulatory contexts. The field would benefit from applying quasi-experimental designs such as difference-in-differences or interrupted time-series approaches, leveraging changes in assurance coverage or regulatory adoption. These should be combined with hybrid human--large language model (LLM) coding frameworks capable of capturing both linguistic and visual dimensions of disclosure tactics. The growing use of LLM-assisted writing introduces both risks and opportunities. Generative tools may homogenize tone, amplify optimism bias in corporate sustainability discourse [26], and reinforce identity-management effects [73]. Conversely, when coupled with transparent codebooks, human adjudication, and validation against objective outcomes, these tools can also enhance the detection of greenwashing. Advancing from proxy-based measures to ground-truth evidence will require the creation of labeled repositories containing report excerpts, graphics, and internal artifacts. Such datasets would enable predictive tests linking specific reporting approaches to subsequent organizational or environmental outcomes.\n\nRecent studies increasingly measure greenwashing through content analysis by examining discrepancies between corporate sustainability disclosures and actual ESG performance. However, empirical evidence indicates that estimates of greenwashing vary substantially depending on the data source used for performance evaluation and the assumed time lag between disclosure and realized outcomes [84,89]. Future research should employ distributed lag models and integrate multiple independent sources of ESG performance data to enhance the reliability and validity of greenwashing assessments. Moreover, existing research has predominantly focused on the environmental pillar, providing limited insight into greenwashing within the social and governance dimensions. It is therefore essential to examine the consistency of disclosure--performance gaps across all ESG pillars and to explore contextual moderators that may influence such decoupling [1,88]. Another promising but underexplored avenue concerns the regulatory effectiveness and auditability of disclosure--performance gap metrics [87]. Future research should investigate whether the introduction or strengthening of disclosure obligations reduces these gaps and which ESG components are most responsive. Moreover, many studies rely on unvalidated coding schemes or subjective classifications methods, raising concerns regarding the construct validity and replicability of greenwashing indicators derived from content analysis. More systematic validation procedures, coupled with the increased application of natural language processing and AI-based techniques, are needed to improve the methodological rigor of future analyses [86,95].\n\nThe symbolic--substantive approach to measure greenwashing also faces several limitations that warrant further research. One major challenge concerns the lack of consistency in how symbolic and substantive disclosures are operationalized. Existing studies employ divergent classification rules, which may yield inconsistent",
        "Conclusions": "conclusions depending on the coding schemes, linguistic contexts, and sectoral characteristics applied [6,24]. Future research should prioritize the development of unified coding frameworks, assess their cross-contextual stability, and validate them across multilingual corpora and industry segments using measurement-invariance techniques.\n\nAnother underexplored area involves the role of stakeholder perceptions in mediating the classification of symbolic versus substantive ESG claims. Current studies often assume homogeneous interpretive frameworks, overlooking how investors, NGOs, regulators, or consumers may differentially interpret identical disclosures [103,107]. Behavioral experiments and stakeholder-centered conjoint analyses could provide valuable insights into these perception gaps. Institutional and internationalization dynamics also warrant deeper examination. Current research provides limited evidence on how a company's degree of internationalization and institutional context influence the symbolic or substantive nature of ESG communication [101,104]. Future research could explore how external pressure and\nlegitimacy demands jointly shape disclosure behavior. Moreover, most current analyses focus on isolated narrative fragments\u2014such as specific phrases or report sections\u2014rather than evaluating the broader alignment between the company's overall discourse and verified ESG outcomes. This narrow focus constrains the ability to detect symbolic decoupling at scale. Future research should adopt more comprehensive, firm-level approaches that link entire report contents to quantifiable performance indicators [102,108]. Digital transparency tools and emerging technological systems also merit greater attention. While some recent studies acknowledge the growing adoption of digital reporting mechanisms, empirical evidence on their impact remains scarce [30,107]. Future research could examine whether tools such as real-time ESG dashboards, structured data reporting, and algorithmic monitoring reduce company' capacity to engage in symbolic disclosure.\n\nDetecting greenwashing through selective disclosure and narrative manipulation likewise represents a rapidly developing research area. Yet, a key limitation lies in the absence of standardized procedures for identifying and classifying such practices across industries, languages, and coding systems. Current studies often rely on heterogeneous textual metrics without confirming measurement invariance, which undermines comparability and replicability [111,116,118]. Future research should aim to establish unified codebooks and multilingual natural language processing (NLP) pipelines, complemented by manual validation of sampled text segments to ensure methodological robustness. The role of institutional investors in shaping information opacity also remains underexplored. Although prior studies have pointed to the potential emergence of \u201cdisclosure fog\u201d in ESG communication, few have empirically examined whether institutional ownership correlates with hedging language, lexical dilution, or selective ESG narrative construction [107,112]. A promising avenue for future research involves exploring whether and how companies imitate competitors' selective disclosure strategies. Textual similarity measures could help detect industry-specific patterns of imitation\u2014such as linguistic convergence in phrasing, tone, or narrative structure [114,117]. Additionally, further investigation is needed into the strategic manipulation of ESG topic emphasis, wherein companies may disproportionately highlight less material or less scrutinized themes. Empirical evidence remains limited regarding whether such shifts in topic salience reflect deliberate narrative avoidance [109,115]. Future studies should apply systematic text-analytic approaches to detect and evaluate the prevalence and implications of these distortive practices in sustainability reporting.\n\nResearch suggests that, while tone analysis in sustainability reporting can be used to detect potential greenwashing, its conceptualization and operationalization remain insufficiently developed. Many studies rely on generic sentiment dictionaries or document-level scores, which risk conflating genuine optimism with impression management, thereby highlighting the need for more nuanced, domain-specific measures [74,119,124]. A key priority should therefore be domain adaptation: specifically, the development of ESG-specific lexicons and fine-tuned models that capture sectoral jargon, regulatory terminology, and claim types, while differentiating genuinely informative positive language from rhetorical attempts at attention deflection. In addition, reporting tactics tend to be localized rather than distributed across an entire document. Positive tone frequently clusters in CEO letters, highlights, or specific KPI sections, whereas negative information is often abstracted, minimized, or relegated to footnotes. These patterns underscore the importance of section- or span-level analyses linked to verifiable performance metrics [70,120]. Current research on tone remains largely monomodal, focusing exclusively on textual content while neglecting images, charts, and other visual or structural cues that can also signal greenwashing. This calls for moving beyond text-only measures toward integrated, multimodal approaches that combine tone, readability, visual analysis, and claim verification. Future studies should therefore tailor sentiment measures to sustainability-specific language, link\ndetected tone distortions to material outcomes, connect tone analysis to KPI-related sections, and validate indicators against real-world evidence\u2014such as verified violations or regulatory actions. Expanding and replicating such analyses across languages, sectors, and time periods will further strengthen the robustness, comparability, and generalizability of findings [74,110,120].\n\nConsidering readability analysis as a tool to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting, it is important to note that standard readability formulas are widely applied but often insufficiently calibrated to the linguistic and conceptual characteristics of ESG disclosures. Low readability may simply reflect the inclusion of necessary technical details rather than an attempt to confuse, while the excessive use of specialized jargon can sometimes be employed to obscure information [74,127,129,130]. Accordingly, readability metrics should be paired with domain-specific indicators\u2014such as levels of specificity, baseline reporting, scope coverage, and verifiability\u2014to better distinguish legitimate complexity from manipulative practices. Document-level readability averages can conceal localized tactics, as clusters of complexity often appear in particular sections\u2014such as CEO letters, KPI or incident notes, and footnotes\u2014precisely where decoupling or attention deflection is most likely to occur. Readability analysis therefore requires section- or span-level granularity linked to the KPIs discussed, in order to differentiate \u201caccessible language on successes\u201d from \u201copaque language on shortcomings.\u201d While many studies relate readability to performance or disclosure style, fewer examine whether readability-based warning signals correspond to verified outcomes such as regulatory violations, enforcement actions, or financial restatements. Future research should leverage pre/post-event trajectories and matched control designs to test whether scrutiny actually disciplines corporate language or merely encourages greenhushing. Studies examining the readability of sustainability reporting frequently face methodological limitations, including a predominant focus on single-country or single-sector samples, reliance on voluntary disclosures, and susceptibility to coder subjectivity. These challenges highlight the need for cross-lingual, multi-year, and multi-industry datasets, transparent codebooks, and human-in-the-loop processes. It is also evident that readability interacts dynamically with tone, as well as with graphical and formatting choices, underscoring the need to develop multimodal analytical pipelines that integrate textual, visual, and claim-verification components [74,113,119].\n\nEmpirical evidence indicates that greenwashing frequently manifests in visual form. Companies can amplify positive outcomes and mute negative ones through the strategic design of charts, layouts, and imagery [80,81]. Yet empirical research often continues to treat visuals as illustrative artifacts rather than as measurable evidence, typically relying on small samples or broad impression-management categorizations [79]. Future studies should therefore advance chart-forensic methodologies that translate potentially misleading design choices into reproducible, quantifiable features and link these visual features to material KPIs (e.g. emissions, water use, accidents) and to verified outcomes such as violations, restatements, or enforcement actions [133]. At present, the available evidence still depends heavily on manual coding and limited samples, with no standardized chart-forensics feature set (e.g. baseline height, axis truncation, unit swaps, selective time windows, and 3D exaggeration). Visuals are also rarely connected to specific KPIs or materiality dimensions, even though greenwashing is often localized\u2014appearing as a flattering chart in highlights, a footnoted base-year reset, or imagery that diverts attention. In addition, theoretical anchoring and causal inference remain weak: graphical manipulation is seldom linked to verified outcomes or exogenous shocks, leaving it unclear whether scrutiny disciplines visual design or merely prompts greenhushing. Moreover, replicable and open figure-level corpora and perception experiments that assess how design choices distort stakeholder judgments remain scarce. Accordingly, future studies should formalize and automate\nchart-forensic feature extraction, analyze visuals at the figure or section-level while linking them to KPIs and materiality, conduct quasi-experimental studies around assurance or regulatory interventions to connect visual-risk scores to verified outcomes, and establish open, replicable figure-level datasets complemented by human perception benchmarks.\n\nEmpirical studies that document actual greenwashing\u2014drawing on enforcement lists, counter-accounts, scandals, or verified violations\u2014have advanced the field beyond purely hypothetical typologies. Nevertheless, several cross-cutting research gaps remain. Research in this area is often event-bound or context-bound, which introduces selection bias and limits external validity. For example, reliance on media-identified cases carries the risk that \u201chidden\u201d offenders remain unobserved [135]. Other limitations include small sample sizes, sector-specific scopes, and short temporal windows, underscoring the potential to scale counter-account methodologies using artificial intelligence and machine learning, and to extend analyses across more diverse sectors and longer time horizons [9,12]. Causal identification also remains underdeveloped, as most studies document associations rather than mechanisms. There is a growing call for clean empirical settings to test whether mandatory reporting regimes genuinely curb greenwashing rather than merely substituting for voluntary signaling. Quasi-experimental designs and broader contextual applications are needed to determine whether markets discipline actual misconduct or simply respond to disclosure salience [135,143]. Moreover, dynamic post-enforcement adaptations remain insufficiently measured. Regulatory scrutiny may prompt companies to shift from exaggeration to attention deflection or selective disclosure, yet systematic pre-/post-tracking is rare [113]. Finally, there is a pressing need for predictive and preventive tools capable of testing whether linguistic and visual features can anticipate future irresponsible behavior, alongside validated multi-metric pipelines\u2014integrating readability, tone, and visual analysis\u2014anchored to verified violations [113,131].\n\nIt should be noted that some studies exhibit a proxy--construct mismatch, inferring greenwashing merely from the issuance of a sustainability report [138], the adoption of reporting frameworks, or the presence of assurance statements without analyzing the actual report content [139]. Such approaches rely on surface-level or indirect indicators that are not validated against concrete evidence, which may conflate weak sustainability performance or incomplete disclosure with deceptive intent, thereby oversimplifying detection. Moreover, the absence of falsification tests, causal analysis, and cross-validation further undermines the reliability and robustness of these findings. Future research could address these limitations through systematic content analysis that explicitly examines omissions, vagueness, and materiality in disclosures, while refining the greenwashing construct with materiality-aware, section-level measures and triangulating proxies through multimodal evidence.\n\nTable 5 presents avenues for advancing research on strategic typologies and measurement approaches for greenwashing in sustainability reporting.\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nTable 5.

Conclusions\n\nThis SLR offers a comprehensive synthesis of research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting. The findings reveal that greenwashing is a multifaceted phenomenon, manifesting through both explicit communicative strategies and more subtle reporting practices. Drawing on a rigorous content analysis of 88 studies, we identify strategic typologies of greenwashing and examine the content-analysis-based measurement approaches employed to detect them.\n\nGreenwashing in sustainability reporting, as highlighted by our SLR, is a complex and multidimensional corporate behavior rather than a uniform practice. Companies often navigate a continuum between substantive action and symbolic disclosure, strategically calibrating the two to balance actual performance with desired perception. This challenges binary typologies and highlights the need for more nuanced conceptual frameworks. Equally important is what companies do not disclose\u2014strategic silence or greenhushing\u2014which reveals a covert dimension of impression management that is often overlooked. Stakeholder perceptions also play a pivotal role: the same report may be viewed as credible by one audience but dismissed as greenwashing by another, reflecting differential interpretations shaped by stakeholder expertise, situational expectations, and evaluative heuristics.\n\nOur SLR identifies three principal content-analysis-based approaches to measuring greenwashing: (1) the disclosure-performance gap, which compares reported versus actual ESG performance; (2) the symbolic-substantive approach, which contrasts qualitative statements with verifiable organizational actions; and (3) selective and manipulative disclosure, which examines biased messaging, tone, and visual framing techniques used to influence stakeholder perceptions. We also show that analytical techniques for detecting greenwashing increasingly focus on linguistic and visual cues in sustainability reports\u2014tone (sentiment and narrative framing), readability (traditional readability indices and machine-learning-based textual-complexity measures), and visual elements (selective emphasis, imagery framing, and graphical distortions). Finally, we contrast empirically substantiated cases of greenwashing with studies relying on simplified or untested assumptions.\n\nWe outline several future research directions to deepen our understanding of greenwashing practices pursued by companies and strengthen the detection and deterrence mechanisms available to stakeholders and regulators. Our findings underscore the need for a holistic, multi-theoretic approach to conceptualizing greenwashing, alongside practical and policy interventions that enhance transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting. Of the future research avenues outlined in this paper, we highlight those we consider most urgent. Collectively, these priorities emphasize methodological rigor and empirical validation, guiding future studies to advance greenwashing research, to help companies avoid deceptive reporting, and to equip policymakers with evidence-based strategies for corporate accountability.\n\nThe first priority is aligning corporate disclosures with actual performance. Researchers should link narrative claims to verified ESG metrics using data-driven approaches,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nincluding supervised machine learning, to detect inconsistencies. Longitudinal case studies can further capture shifts between substantive and symbolic reporting over time. This line of inquiry responds to calls for more systematic alignment of sustainability narratives with performance outcomes, enabling academics to refine existing theories, helping managers identify communication blind spots, and allowing regulators to target audits more effectively where claims diverge from underlying metrics.\n\nClosely related is the need to study \u201cgreenhushing\u201d\u2014strategic omissions in sustainability communication. Companies' silence on material issues often escapes conventional analytical techniques. Future research should model disclosure decisions at the margin, identifying what is omitted and why, using methods such as anonymous managerial surveys, KPI-report gap analyses, and sector-specific case studies in high-risk industries. This complements work on overstated claims, reveals the concealed side of impression management, refines theories of decoupling, alerts companies to the risks embedded in nondisclosure, and supports policymakers in closing omission-based loopholes.\n\nAnother underexplored area is expanding greenwashing research on SMEs and emerging-market businesses. Our SLR shows that most empirical evidence is concentrated among large, publicly traded companies in developed countries. It is therefore critical to examine whether greenwashing typologies apply across diverse organizational and institutional contexts. Multi-country studies using context-rich interviews and comparative content analysis could illuminate local disclosure practices, refine theoretical generalizability, provide practitioners with more relevant benchmarks, and help policymakers tailor reporting standards to heterogeneous business environments.\n\nA further priority is evaluating the causal impact of regulations and assurance mechanisms on greenwashing. Although external assurance and mandatory reporting standards are often assumed to deter deceptive communication, robust empirical evidence remains limited. Quasi-experimental designs\u2014such as difference-in-differences around new disclosure mandates or transitions from limited to reasonable assurance\u2014could credibly isolate these effects. Establishing causal relationships would advance legitimacy theory, guide regulators in evaluating policy effectiveness, and help companies understand the true costs and benefits of compliance.\n\nThe rise of generative AI (LLMs) in sustainability reporting constitutes a timely and increasingly consequential research frontier. AI-assisted writing may standardize stylistic features, homogenize tone, and amplify optimism bias in ways that subtly shape stakeholder interpretations. Comparative studies of human and AI-authored excerpts\u2014using stylometric techniques, semantic-shift analyses, and hybrid human-AI annotation\u2014can uncover nuanced linguistic changes introduced by AI tools. Curated and labeled datasets can further support models designed to detect AI-driven alterations in sustainability narratives. Such research becomes particularly urgent in the light of rapid AI adoption, offering insights into emerging forms of impression management, alerting companies to AI-driven biases, and informing regulators as they consider guidelines for the responsible use of AI in reporting.\n\nA cross-cutting priority is the standardization and validation of measurement approaches. Developing unified codebooks, ESG sentiment lexicons, and validated NLP pipelines\u2014tested across languages, industries, and reporting regimes\u2014would enhance construct clarity, methodological comparability, and replicability. A more cohesive analytical framework would facilitate reliable academic comparisons, provide practitioners with dependable benchmarks for assessing reports, and equip regulators with robust indicators to support enforcement and oversight.\n\nFuture research should also advance toward the use of multimodal content analysis. Constructing multimodal pipelines that integrate NLP, readability metrics, and visual\nforensic techniques would enable researchers to capture modes of framing and narrative construction that are overlooked by text-only approaches. This comprehensive perspective can reveal subtler forms of impression management, assist companies in improving the coherence and transparency of report design, and provide regulators with more sophisticated tools to audit sustainability disclosures holistically.\n\nFinally, developing predictive greenwashing models represents a critical step toward proactive oversight. By leveraging both linguistic and visual features, researchers can build labeled repositories of verified cases and train machine-learning classifiers to detect patterns that precede misconduct. Such models would offer academics new insights into the antecedents of greenwashing, provide regulators with data-driven risk scores to guide targeted inspections, and enable companies to use these tools for internal compliance monitoring.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, this study contributes to the consolidation of fragmented conceptualizations of greenwashing by linking them to broader discussions on organizational legitimacy, ethics, and corporate communication. Methodologically, it systematizes the existing tools for identifying greenwashing through content analysis and proposes a comprehensive agenda to advance both methodological rigor and theoretical depth. From a practical perspective, the findings provide actionable guidance for policymakers, sustainability officers, corporate managers, and board members responsible for ESG reporting and communication, helping them enhance the credibility of sustainability reporting. By emphasizing transparency, verifiability, and balanced disclosure, this study encourages organizations to move beyond symbolic compliance toward genuine accountability. Ultimately, this review reinforces the importance of integrating theoretical depth with methodological rigor to better understand, detect, and prevent greenwashing\u2014thereby fostering more credible, trustworthy, and sustainable corporate communication practices.\n\nAlthough this study offers valuable insights for scholars and practitioners, several limitations should be acknowledged. The systematic review relied exclusively on publications indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. While these databases are widely regarded as authoritative sources and are commonly used for literature reviews and bibliometric analyses, this choice may have excluded relevant publications on greenwashing strategies and content-based measurement approaches indexed in other databases (e.g. Google Scholar or EBSCO). Additionally, non-English publications were omitted, which may have limited the diversity of perspectives included in this review. However, incorporating articles in languages other than English would have significantly increased the time and resources required due to translation needs. Given that most reputable, indexed journals publish primarily in English, this trade-off was considered acceptable. The findings are also influenced by the chosen search terms; alternative keyword combinations might yield different results, particularly given the variety of expressions related to \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and \u201csustainability reporting\u201d. However, the selection of search terms was guided by a comprehensive review of prior studies, and Boolean operators were applied to broaden the search strategy. We also undertook extensive reference screening to identify relevant work that might not emerge through keyword-based searches. Although search-term bias cannot be entirely eliminated, these procedures substantially mitigate its effects in our review. Furthermore, while content analysis inevitably entails some degree of subjectivity, this risk was mitigated through independent coding by two researchers.\n\nDespite these constraints, this study provides a structured and integrative synthesis of existing knowledge on greenwashing in sustainability reporting and identifies promising avenues for future theoretical development and empirical exploration.\n\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/su18010017/s1, Table S1: PRISMA 2020 Checklist.\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.J. and A.R.; methodology, A.J. and A.R.; investigation, A.J. and A.R.; data curation, A.J. and A.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.J. and A.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.J. and A.R.; visualization, A.J. and A.R.

By analyzing both general visibility (sensitive industry membership) and issue visibility (sustainability controversies), we aim to provide insights into how managers utilize linguistic style in response to visibility pressures.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 2,139 SR CEO letters, we examine functional, affective, and cognitive linguistic elements and identify three prominent style profiles: formal-analytical, assertive, and defensive. Multivariate regression is employed to test how general and issue visibility affect these profiles.\n\nFindings: CEOs in less visible industries tend to show a higher propensity for assertive language to project leadership and control. In contrast, companies with higher general visibility tend to use more analytical language, suggesting that formally and logically aligning with public information seems to be a pragmatic way for CEOs in sensitive industries to establish credibility and legitimacy. However, when these CEOs face sustainability controversies, they step in head-on to contextualize the issues in a reactive manner to contain legitimacy threats.\n\nOriginality: Our research offers a fine-grained linguistic focus on IM in SR CEO letters, highlighting prominent linguistic style patterns and underlying drivers. We show that the identified language styles are not mutually exclusive but are triggered by distinct legitimacy concerns. We explicitly consider interdependency between the CEO letter and the main report and assess readability as a derivative of primary stylistic choice. The sample allows us to make inferences on how capital market differences affect CEO language postures.\n\nKeywords: sustainability reporting; impression management; legitimacy theory; visibility dynamics; corporate communication; sustainability communication\n\n1\n# 1.",
        "Introduction": "Introduction\n\nSustainability reporting (SR)\u00b9 is used as a communication tool providing information on companies\u2019 sustainability-related activities to address the societal call for sustainable business and to build, enhance or repair organizational legitimacy. As the demand for transparency and accountability regarding corporate sustainability has been increasing among stakeholders, SR has become a standard corporate practice. Many studies, however, have demonstrated false claims, unmet promises or omitted performance outcomes in SR, which cause concerns that organizations \u201ctalk but do not walk the sustainability\u201d. Consequently, the credibility and the quality of sustainability-related disclosures are often debated in the interdisciplinary accounting literature, suggesting that SR is prone to impression management (IM) strategies. While the literature offers extensive empirical evidence of IM in SR, its antecedents are not fully understood. In our study, we contribute to filling this research gap by focusing on linguistic style features of CEO narratives in SR as indicators of rhetorical IM.\n\nNarrative sections in SR contain personalized messages and business tales, addressing key corporate events, achievements and future prospects as presented by the corporate leader (Fuoli, 2018). We explore corporate visibility as a driver and/or constraint of IM practices in CEO letters, in line with Leary and Kowalski (1990). Our investigation distinguishes between general (related to industry membership) and issue visibility (driven by sustainability controversies reflecting unethical and irresponsible business behavior), both of which hold particular relevance in sustainability research (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). While several authors argue that increased visibility and related scrutiny, make companies less prone to IM (e.g., Marquis et al., 2016), others suggest that companies with higher environmental exposure and institutional pressure - and consequently, greater public visibility - are more inclined to engage in IM practices to legitimize their environmentally unfriendly operations (e.g., Stacchezzini et al., 2016). We address these contradictions in the literature in three ways.\n\nFirst, drawing upon legitimacy theory, we argue that general and issue visibility relate to different legitimacy-related motives, i.e., maintaining legitimacy versus repairing legitimacy, which promote distinct IM strategies to match legitimacy-related requirements. The level of scrutiny for overt IM is clearly higher for companies operating in sustainability-sensitive industries\u00b2 (hereafter referred to as sensitive industries), where the institutional environment is characterized by stringent regulations and governance structures due to their higher business exposure (Aerts and Cormier, 2009). For companies operating in sensitive industries, using formal and analytical language strategically in concert with institutionalized reporting formats and avoiding explicit self-serving IM are expected to foster perceived accountability and transparency and, thus, maintain legitimacy. Issue visibility driven by sustainability controversies, on the other hand, creates a gap between the desired and current image of companies through media and news and disrupts the legitimacy status-quo (Kuruppu et al., 2019). In such cases, managers are forced to respond to this disruption to repair damaged legitimacy by applying reactive IM strategies (Arvidsson, 2010). As the relationship between general visibility and the use of IM strategies is context-dependent and is likely to be affected\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 In the literature, different terms have been used for SR, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting; social/environmental reporting; environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting; corporate social disclosures, etc. In this paper, we systematically use \u201csustainability reporting\u201d, following the inclusive definition of sustainability in the Brundtland Report (1987).\n\n\u00b2 Following prior literature (Garcia et al., 2017; Passetti et al., 2018), we define sustainability-sensitive industries as those having a major socio-environmental impact and being subject to social taboos, moral debates and political pressures. These industries include materials (chemicals, metals &amp; mining, forestry-paper &amp; wood products), electric utilities, and oil and gas producers.\nby the company's business exposure, we also assess the effect of the interaction of industry and controversies on the use of IM.\n\nSecond, prior SR studies have predominantly focused on content-based IM, including selective disclosure (e.g., Marquis et al., 2016, Roszkowska-Menkes et al., 2024) and imagery (e.g., Boiral, 2013), while little attention has been paid to style-related IM, i.e., managers' use of language. The discretionary nature of corporate narratives can be exploited opportunistically by managers by crafting linguistic style to guide readers on how content is to be appreciated along a preferred mindset (Talbot and Boiral, 2018). Style-based IM can take a variety of forms using affective tone, personalization or cognitive devices (e.g., causal language, certainty expressions, etc.). While the limited prior research in this area has primarily examined readability manipulation as an obfuscation strategy (e.g., Li et al., 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018), our study offers a more nuanced analysis of linguistic style in SR.\n\nFinally, we focus on the CEO letter as a distinct genre within SR, offering the highest degree of freedom in editorial and linguistic choice and not directly burdened by institutionalized reporting frameworks. Research on the actual talk of sustainability in the CEO letter is currently rather limited (Arvidsson, 2023). We need to acknowledge, however, that the CEO letter is not a comprehensive nor an independent SR vehicle. It is rather a somewhat superimposed piece in the SR repertoire that provides the CEO the opportunity to put a personal stamp on how to position the corporate sustainability challenge, but with the main report as the bottom line. Editorial choice may materialize in summarizing highlights of the main report, introducing the general setting or providing closure of the issues involved. Whatever the chosen editorial perspective, it can be assumed that the level of transparency of the main report will affect the language use in the CEO report. By disregarding the specific status and interdependency of the CEO letter, previous studies might have overlooked the nuanced ways in which CEOs' editorializing complements the main report responding to stakeholders' legitimacy concerns. By controlling for the overall transparency level of SR, we investigate how CEOs engage with the information presented therein.\n\nTo this end, we employ a sample of 2,139 CEO letters from 384 companies from the EU, the UK and the US that published a stand-alone SR between 2010 and 2019. We utilize the three summary variables and the cognitive processes variable of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, which reveal the functional, affective and cognitive linguistic elements encompassed within SR CEO letters. Through factor analysis, we identify rhetorical profiles in SR CEO letters. This approach yields three rhetorical profiles: (1) formal-analytical; (2) assertive; and (3) defensive. Formal-analytical relates to formal, rational and hierarchical language use (Pennebaker et al., 2015), while assertive and defensive relate to narrative styles that are less technical and less factual but imply purposeful sense-giving (Arvidsson and Johansson, 2019, Caliskan et al., 2021). Using the three profiles, we test our hypotheses using multivariate regression analyses. In doing so, our analysis goes beyond the limited body of research on rhetorical IM in SR, which predominantly relies on qualitative methodologies with a small sample size.\n\nOur findings document that CEOs in more visible industries show a lower propensity to use assertive rhetorical IM refraining from outward-facing and authoritative communication. These companies tend to use more formal-analytical language in CEO letters. It reflects a risk-averse and personally detached CEO stance, aimed at maintaining legitimacy under greater scrutiny and governance pressure by fostering an aura of accountability and objectivity. This would imply that general visibility is not a motivator for explicit IM but rather acts as a constraint. However, when companies in sensitive industries are faced with company-specific sustainability challenges, CEOs step in to actively explain or contextualize the issues in a reactive manner to repair/restore threatened legitimacy. Our results suggest that the CEO's\n\n3\nreactive cognitive framing in response to controversies is mainly prompted by general visibility. Interestingly, we find that identified explicit IM styles are both positively correlated with readability, shedding new light on the use of low readability as a proxy for IM in prior studies. With respect to the interdependency between the CEO letter and the main part of the report, our results indicate that, in general, higher disclosure transparency tends to promote more formal-analytical language and less rhetorical IM by the CEO. This suggests that CEO letters are, indeed, not independent documents separate from the main report and that CEOs appear to consider the company's general disclosure transparency when constructing their narrative. Overall, our results offer valuable insights into the interconnections among visibility, scrutiny and concerns about legitimacy, enriching the scholarly discourse within the field of corporate sustainability.\n\nThe remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: The second part provides a brief",
        "Literature review": "literature review of SR and IM. In the third part, we introduce visibility notions and develop our hypotheses. The methodology used is presented in part four. The fifth part presents our research findings (including robustness checks). Finally, in part six, we discuss our findings and conclude.\n\n## 2. Literature review\n\n### 2.1. SR and related CEO letters from the legitimacy lens\n\nPrior research shows that SR is considered a hybrid disclosure outlet, combining both promotional and informative functions (Fuoli, 2018). Promotional aspects are particularly evident in narrative sections that stress storytelling which is crucial in shaping stakeholder perception (Aerts and Cormier, 2009; Marais, 2012). The SR CEO letter is prominent in this regard. It is generally acknowledged that the CEO letter is one of the most read parts of the annual report (e.g., Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Amernic et al., 2010; Liu and Liu, 2023). While CEOs may not be the primary authors of these letters (Liu and Nguyen, 2020), which are presumably the \u201cend product that has been filtered through several layers in the company\u201d (Arvidsson, 2023, p. 34), CEOs exert significant influence on both their content and linguistic style (Post et al., 2022). Bearing their signature, CEOs have a personal interest in at least closely reviewing and approving the final version of the CEO letter before making it public (Amernic et al., 2010)\u00b3. A CEO letter is, however, not written in isolation. It is not a standalone reporting device but rather an integral part of the SR repertoire. As such, it needs to be understood as a highly discretionary component part of the larger SR package. This may mean significant interdependency with the scope and content of the main sustainability reports and a high degree of diversity in editorial choices made across companies.\n\nOverall, legitimacy theory views SR as a means to uphold legitimacy and address external pressures (Cho and Patten, 2007). Organizational legitimacy can be sustained or altered either through corporate actions or by managing perceptions, with the latter probably being the easier and cheaper alternative (Bansal and Kistruck, 2006). In this regard, SR CEO letters can be used as a symbolic legitimacy tool to proactively bolster or amend the company image and reputation or to repair damaged legitimacy (Cho and Patten, 2007). From this perspective, SR CEO letters do not always reflect a company's authentic dedication to sustainability (Talbot and Boiral, 2018), nor are they solely motivated by transparency and\n\n\u00b3 Prior research convincingly demonstrates that CEO characteristics (e.g., gender, overconfidence, narcissism) influence the language (e.g., tone, readability) used in CEO letters (Liu and Nguyen, 2020; Le Maux and Smaili, 2024). In a similar vein, studies show that CEO changes lead to variations in style, length, and content of the letters, while letters signed by the same CEO tend to exhibit consistency (Eggers and Kaplan, 2009). Indeed, famous business leaders, such as Jack Welch and Warren Buffet, publicly acknowledged their strong involvement in shaping their CEO letters (Amernic et al., 2010).\naccountability concerns, but also need to be understood as a response to external scrutiny pressures (Cho et al., 2010). Moreover, Marais (2012) points out the predominance of the theme of moral legitimacy when communicating sustainability efforts, with an emphasis on portraying the organization as a good corporate citizen by employing discourse of goodwill and through invoking emotion and affection to persuade the audience. Such a communication approach would necessarily rely on language and rhetoric to convince the audience of a preferred mindset.\n\n## 2.2. Impression Management\n\nPerception management within the context of legitimacy strategies is close to the concept of IM which refers to the processes by which people manage and control the image they display with the intention of changing the impression of others in order to be perceived and evaluated more favorably (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Leary and Kowalski (1990) portray an array of IM drivers that either relate to IM motivation or IM construction\u2074. We argue that the visibility dimensions that we investigate in this study, are circumstantially related to both components of their model.\n\nIn SR narratives, IM can be achieved through thematic control (e.g., biased selection of themes, performance comparisons or visual presentation) and through style control (e.g., the use of complicated language to obfuscate bad news) (Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). What we refer to as rhetorical IM are editorial and linguistic choices that are instrumental in building support, convincing investors, and sustaining confidence and credibility; they are primarily style-related.\n\nTraditionally, IM in narrative disclosures has been mainly studied by examining the relationship between linguistic features and organizational performance (Melloni et al., 2016). When company activities and outcomes are desirable, managers tend to adopt IM as an assertive strategy in a proactive manner to enhance and emphasize companies' positive outcomes to gain competitive advantage (Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Boiral et al., 2020). Assertive IM involves highlighting unique organizational competencies and business skills (Boiral et al., 2020; Bolino et al., 2008). Managers using this strategy stress the importance, relevance and scope of positive environmental outcomes or actions positing an acclaiming and self-confident stance in the message delivered (Aerts and Cormier, 2009; Aerts and Yan, 2017). In other words, the aim of assertive IM is to make a positive outcome more obvious to the audience and project an impression of organizational success. These strategies are reflected in managers' use of language, where a stronger positive tone, extensive self-referencing, emphatic certainty expressions and achievement- and future-related content",
        "References": "references are used (Aerts and Yan, 2017). In the context of SR, scarce evidence suggests that in companies with good sustainability performance, managers tend to use a tone of optimism, clarity and certainty, as well as readable language to signal their achievements (Li et al., 2023).\n\nIn circumstances that threaten legitimacy, managers tend to employ defensive IM strategies (Bolino et al., 2008). In the literature, defensive IM strategies, which encompass distractions, apologies, excuses, justifications or self-handicapping, are used as an umbrella term for reactive mechanisms (Boiral et al., 2020). By using such techniques, managers can deny responsibility for negative outcomes, or seek to re-establish a positive identity by removing negative perceptions and purposefully giving sense to the organization's actions (Caliskan et al., 2021). They may also prefer to withhold or obfuscate unfavorable\n\n\u2074 IM motivation reflects the desire to influence others' perceptions, while IM construction focuses on determining the impressions one aims to create and the strategies to achieve them. IM motivation is associated with goal-relevance of impressions, value of desired goals and discrepancy between desired and current image. The second component, IM construction, relates to self-concept, desired and undesired identity images, role constraints, target\u2019s values and current or potential social image (Leary and Kowalski, 1990).\nperformance-related information (Fabrizio and Kim, 2019). Defensive strategies have also been associated with less readable disclosures (Li et al., 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018) to obfuscate poor results or with the remedial use of causal language in order to rationalize negatively perceived outcomes and minimize management responsibility for them (Zhang and Aerts, 2015).\n\nMost IM mechanisms studied in prior SR research (such as thematic choice, arguments offered and attributional analysis) rely on a combination of thematic or propositional content and style features. The rhetorical IM features that we investigate are, however, largely detached from the substance or propositional content of the CEO letter, but are deemed to be important to ground the persuasiveness and credibility of the message. For example, assertive language usually relies on a positive tone, extensive self-referencing, clarity and certainty expressions. For defensive IM, managers tend to use more cautious framing and sense-giving devices, such as engagement markers (e.g., \"consider\", \"note that\", \"you can see that\") that \"project an aura of credibility gained by openness\" and hedging expressions (e.g., \"might\", \"perhaps\", \"possible\") which help create distance from the message and avoid direct responsibility (Aerts and Yan, 2017, p. 416; Hyland, 1998). Those linguistic style markers are helpful in organizing and evaluating propositional content in such a way that readers are guided and directed to how they should distill meaning from, appraise and respond to the information presented (Crismore et al., 1993). They add a sense-giving layer to propositional content and tend to reveal the messenger's stance with regard to the issues involved. Their effectiveness will ultimately depend on the credibility of the signals involved. Credible signals will have to resonate with the background expectations of the audience. In that regard, rhetorical signals must be perceived as credible, not only within the context of the CEO letter as such, but also within the larger disclosure environment of which the CEO letter is only a part. Public industry knowledge and evidence of company-specific performance and behavior as embedded in the larger information environment may act as a constraint on the construction of credible IM.\n\n## 3.",
        "Hypotheses development": "Hypotheses development\n\nThe main research question of this study is how corporate visibility affects rhetorical IM in SR CEO letters. Corporate visibility has multiple dimensions including general visibility, reflecting the degree to which a company is salient or prominent in the public eye due to its size or industry membership (Ruiz-Blanco et al., 2021), and issue visibility, reflecting the salience of company-specific issues or controversies (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). Visibility tends to escalate institutional pressure and public scrutiny over corporate behavior. As such, it is believed to affect companies' tendency to symbolism and IM (Greenwood et al., 2011). General visibility is associated with stringent scrutiny over corporate activities and disclosures, yet it does not create a legitimacy threat as such. Disruption in the \"legitimacy status-quo\" can be a result of a major sustainability controversy that increases the issue visibility of a company.\n\n## 3.1. General visibility and IM\n\nWhile heightened general visibility associated with sensitive industry membership might increase awareness of the importance of SR and stakeholder engagement, it does not necessarily translate into a direct motivation for IM. Instead, it fosters a complex interplay between institutional pressures, perceived risks and strategic communication choices.\n\nCompanies in sensitive industries, such as oil and gas extraction or chemical manufacturing, often have greater business exposure, defined as the degree to which an organization affects its environment and is affected by it (Michelon et al., 2013). This heightened exposure translates into increased scrutiny from a broad range of stakeholders and\ncreates a strong incentive to maintain legitimacy and the social license to operate through transparent and consensual reporting (Arvidsson, 2014). Institutional literature argues that in a scrutinized environment, accountability and reporting practices tend to become ritualized, largely due to coercive isomorphism stemming from shared agreements and industry regulations (Larrinaga-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007). To maintain legitimacy, managers operating in sensitive industries tend to imitate the decisions and reporting practices of industry leaders within the same institutional reference groups (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Van Caneghem and Aerts, 2011). This mimetic isomorphism can lead to increased standardization and use of generally accepted reporting formats, potentially limiting opportunities for more nuanced or individually tailored IM strategies (Aerts and Tarca, 2010).\n\nThese arguments suggest that general visibility is not a motivator for IM, but rather acts as a constraint of IM, whereby the current public image of companies in sensitive industries (as embedded in public industry knowledge and documented in transparent SR formats) curbs the construction of IM alternatives (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Given the low probability of success in creating an alternative impression when the current public image is salient, people are reluctant to present themselves in ways that are inconsistent with information others have about them (Leary and Kowalski, 1990, p. 42). This would, a fortiori, apply to the CEO letter for which the main sustainability report presets a large part of public company-specific information to which the CEO must relate in the CEO letter. Further, the presence of an evaluative audience, aware of the potential for IM, can create a cautious disclosure attitude in corporate narratives. Recognizing that IM strategies can backfire and be perceived as misleading or \"cheap talk\" in a highly scrutinized environment (Rogers et al., 2011), managers in sensitive industries might avoid overtly promotional language and prioritize presenting objective, verifiable data to support their claims. This aligns with Aerts et al.'s (2013) finding that in highly scrutinized contexts, managers tend to favor technical accounting explanations based on formal and analytical language over more discretionary causal expressions. Thus, while not precluding all forms of IM, the heightened scrutiny in sensitive industries likely shifts the focus toward substantiating claims with verifiable data and aligning with industry best practices, potentially leading to a more cautious and less overtly promotional communication style. This strategic response basically aims at protecting the company's reputation and maintaining legitimacy by minimizing the risk of criticism.\n\nIn contrast, companies in non-sensitive industries may operate with less public visibility and face less stringent regulatory pressures, creating a more discretionary reporting environment. Crilly et al. (2012, p. 1436) argue that companies in non-sensitive industries hold \"high potential for information asymmetry and can easily build smokescreens around their internal practices\". This reduced scrutiny may create opportunities for the CEO for purposive editorializing language and tone, using interactional cues of rational, affective and interpersonal appeal that go beyond matter-of-fact reporting and guide the audience to a preferred mindset. Based on the above discussion, we predict the following:\n\nH1a: General visibility driven by sensitive industry membership is positively associated with the use of more formal and analytical language in the CEO letter.\n\nH1b: General visibility driven by sensitive industry membership is negatively associated with the use of more explicit rhetorical IM in the CEO letter.\n\n## 3.2. Issue visibility and IM\nIssue visibility is prompted by the salience of company-specific sustainability-related issues or controversies. Corporate controversies, defined as publicly observable events that are expected to have negative implications on the firm (Del Giudice and Rigamonti, 2020, p.2), attract media attention and create a gap between a company's desired image and its current, less favorable public perception, ultimately jeopardizing the company's legitimacy and value (DasGupta, 2021; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992).\n\nDrawing on Leary and Kowalski's (1990) two-component model of IM, we argue that sustainability controversies affect both impression motivation and impression construction. Controversies not only increase public perception, making impressions more goal-relevant, but also highlight the discrepancy between a company's desired and current image, both increasing managers' motivation to employ IM strategies. The choice of IM strategy is influenced by the current and potential social image that the company aims to project. Sustainability controversies, as public failures, damage a firm's current image and compel managers to adopt face-saving strategies and legitimization tactics such as apologies, excuses, and self-serving attributions to dissociate themselves from negative events (Boiral, 2016; Hahn and L\u00fclf s, 2014).\n\nMost narrative IM tactics blend propositional content with an appropriate language style. A defensive style tends to include cognitive mechanisms, such as tentative expression, hedges, directive language and insight words, that signal cognitive effort and facilitate coherence and comprehension of the message by the receiver (Hyland, 1998). They tend to invoke plausibility rather than certainty. Such cognitive mechanisms are helpful in signaling the presence of a considerate, capable and honest communicator. As such, they are likely to sustain the CEO's credibility and honesty, making it easier for stakeholders to connect with the challenges and constraints of the company (Aerts and Yan, 2017). Relatedly, sustainability controversies are likely to undermine the credibility of an overly optimistic tone and of self-serving acclaiming and storytelling. Further, as reported by Rogers et al. (2011), overly optimistic language (as in assertiveness) can increase litigation risks during corporate controversies.\n\nConversely, in the absence of controversy, CEOs have more room to proactively claim positive achievements and to portray a positive image of an authoritative, confident and engaging actor in the sustainability domain. As Tata and Prasad (2015) suggest, CEOs in companies with a neutral or favorable public image are likely to use assertive communication to further enhance their reputation, while companies facing negative publicity are more likely to adopt a more protective stance. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n\nH2a: Issue visibility driven by sustainability controversies is positively associated with defensive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter.\n\nH2b: Issue visibility driven by sustainability controversies is negatively associated with assertive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter.\n\nSustainability controversies pose a legitimacy risk for all companies; however, firms operating in sensitive industries are particularly vulnerable due to heightened public and regulatory scrutiny associated with the inherent risks of their operations. Greater business exposure would exacerbate reputational and financial vulnerabilities when controversies put legitimacy in jeopardy (Aouadi and Marsat, 2018; Del Giudice and Rigamonti, 2020). In sensitive industries, where accidents are especially costly to the environment and society, regulators tend to be less forgiving than in non-sensitive industries (DesJardine et al., 2023).\n\n8\nThe higher damage potential of controversies in sensitive industries may heighten the perceived severity of image discrepancies and increase the goal relevance of perception management (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). We expect this to act as a strong motivator for CEOs in sensitive industries to take up an active rhetorical stance to engage with the audience in an effort to restore perceived legitimacy in a reactive mode. Only relating to or reinforcing corporate disclosures from the main report through complacent formal language in a descriptive or analytic fashion would not suffice in that regard. To restore confidence, effective rhetorical language is expected to invoke a sense of immediacy in order to rationalize or normalize mediatized controversies. This is consistent with prior research demonstrating the use of legitimization strategies for negative incidents among sensitive industries (Hahn and L\u00fclf, 2014; Talbot and Boiral, 2018).\n\nMoreover, given the challenges managers in sensitive industries face when trying to highlight favorable outcomes from their sustainability initiatives, we project that general visibility will amplify the CEOs' resistance to using an assertive communication style when addressing controversies. In non-sensitive industries, controversies may be seen as exceptions rather than part of a pattern, allowing companies more leeway to use assertive language or make positive statements in their responses. In contrast, companies in sensitive industries have high base-level exposures (Cho and Patten, 2007) and operate under higher stakeholder situational skepticism (Aqueveque et al., 2018). As such, they are closely scrutinized on how they respond to controversial issues, with particular attention to misleading claims (Marshall et al., 2023). Consequently, companies in sensitive industries are less inclined to manage their public image through the disclosure of positive information related to sustainability issues that are subject to controversy, compared to their counterparts in the less sensitive sectors (Roszkowska-Menkes et al., 2024). Thus, we expect that:\n\nH3a: The positive relationship between issue visibility and defensive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter is positively moderated by general visibility.\n\nH3b: The negative relationship between issue visibility and assertive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter is negatively moderated by general visibility.\n\n## 4. Methodology\n\nTo study rhetorical IM in SR, we employ a three-step methodological approach. First, we conduct an automated text analysis to examine the linguistic style features in SR CEO letters. Second, we conduct a factor analysis to reveal co-occurrence patterns among linguistic markers derived from the previous step to identify rhetorical IM profiles. Finally, we test our hypotheses in empirical models with the rhetorical profiles as dependent variables.\n\n## 4.1. Sample selection and data collection\n\nWe selected listed companies from the EU, the UK and the US that published a stand-alone SR for the fiscal year 2016 according to the Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters\u2019 Asset4ESG) database. The sample composition allows diversity in country-level institutional context that has been shown to affect language postures (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Liu and Liu, 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020). In this regard, we sample companies from the US, UK and Continental Europe respectively to include implicit (Continental Europe) and explicit (US and UK to a lesser degree) CSR institutional environments (Matten and Moon, 2008). Moreover, the sample composition also captures capital market differences that may affect the goal relevance and the value of desired outcomes of IM (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Structural differences in share ownership and shareholder activism as well as CEO pecuniary differentials that exist among\nAnglo-Saxon and continental European countries may affect CEO motivation to engage in IM. For example, institutional differences in CEO power and CEO compensation may affect the value of desired IM outcomes, suggesting a higher propensity in portraying CEO leadership identity and managerial competence to preserve power and lucrative compensation arrangements in an Anglo-Saxon market environment.\n\nWe extended the time frame for the selected companies from 2010 to 2019 and manually collected the reports in PDF from their websites, corporate register (corporateregister.com), and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) database (globalreporting.org). We excluded companies that operate in the healthcare, financials, real estate, government activities, and academic and educational services sectors; companies that do not publish their reports in English; companies that use integrated reporting; SR that do not include CEO letters; SR that are protected and cannot be processed; and CEO letters counting fewer than 350 words\u2075 in length. We manually processed CEO letters in SR in accordance with prior research and excluded CEO letters that do not contain sustainability-related information. This selection process yielded a sample of 2,139 CEO letters from 384 companies that we later used in factor analysis to create rhetoric variables. We combined the sample of CEO letters with data we needed for explanatory and control variables derived from Refinitiv and Bloomberg and excluded observations with missing data. The final sample used in the multivariate analyses consists of 1,805 CEO letters from 345 companies headquartered in 18 countries\u2076.\n\n## 4.2. Linguistic analysis\n\nTo examine the linguistic style used in CEO letters, we use LIWC-22, which is based on strong empirical evidence that language can provide rich insights into people's psychological states, including emotions, thinking styles, and social concerns (Boyd et al., 2022). This software has been extensively tested in numerous social psychology studies and has also been used in the corporate reporting context (e.g., Aerts and Yan, 2017; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). We use LIWC-22 to reveal the functional, affective and cognitive components of the CEO letters. We employ the three summary psychosocial variables of LIWC: (1) analytical thinking; (2) clout; and (3) emotional tone. In addition to these, we use the cognitive processes variable. The three summary variables are composite measures derived from previously published findings from Pennebaker Language Lab and converted to percentiles based on standardized scores from large comparison samples (Boyd et al., 2022). Each of the variables is transformed into a scale from 1 to 100, and they are mainly based on function words. Function words have been found to be reliable markers of psychological states, revealing how people think (Pennebaker et al., 2014). For example, high use of single-person or second/third-person pronouns has been associated with self- or other-focus, respectively; auxiliary verbs with the use of passive language; articles with formal and structured style of writing; and conjunctions with cognitive complexity (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Pennebaker et al., 2007). The analytical thinking variable captures the degree to which people use words that suggest formal, logical and hierarchical thinking patterns (Pennebaker et al., 2015). The lexical categories of a higher analytical thinking score include articles, prepositions which reflect a more technical language; while a lower score includes pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions and adverbs which reflect a more informal and personal language (Pennebaker et al., 2015). The clout variable refers to the relative social status, confidence, or leadership that people display through their language (Boyd et al., 2022). A higher clout score is measured by 1\u02e2\u1d57 person plural (we) and second-person pronouns (you), which reflects confident, credible and collectively-oriented language; while a lower clout score is measured by tentative words (e.g.,\n\n\u2075 Prior text analysis software baseline its measures based on a minimum of 350 words (https://docs.receptiviti.com/). Hence, we impose a minimum word limit for our investigation based on 350 words.\n\n\u2076 In Appendices, we present more detailed selection criteria (Table-AI) and the final sample summary statistics (Table-AII) with respect to distribution by year, country, region, and industry.\n\n10\nmaybe, perhaps) reflecting tentativeness, humble and anxious language (Kacewicz et al., 2014; Pennebaker et al., 2015). Finally, the emotional tone variable puts positive tone and negative tone dimensions into a single variable (Cohn et al., 2004). The higher the score, the more positive the tone is. Tone as a measure of text sentiment has been widely used as a proxy of disclosure balance in SR. Table I summarizes the indicators of analytical thinking, clout, and emotional tone, their directions and example words.\n\n--- [Insert Table I about here] ---\n\nCognitive processes is another composite variable that includes markers of cognitive complexity such as insight, causation, discrepancy, tentative, certitude and differentiation words. Cognitive processes words signal thought, causality and insight, and are used in situations, when people wish to transmit facts, reconstruct events and provide explanations for them (Brownlow et al., 2020, pp. 11-12). Sense-giving in accounting narratives largely depends on these linguistic devices (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). The composite variable is expressed as a percentage of the total words used in any given language sample. Table II presents components of the cognitive processes variable with their most frequently used exemplars.\n\n--- [Insert Table II about here] ---\n\n## 4.3. Factor analysis\n\nWe use the LIWC-derived variables as inputs to factor analysis to identify salient linguistic structures in the CEO letters. We employ principal component factor analysis with varimax orthogonal rotation. The identified constructs serve further as our test variables. Table III shows the resulting variables and their respective factor loadings.\n\n--- [Insert Table III about here] ---\n\nThe analysis led to the identification of two uncorrelated factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, which cumulatively explain 72% of the overall variance. They group the stylistic and content characteristics that tend to co-occur in SR CEO letters, revealing the main explicit IM profiles in our sample. We use a cut-off of 0.20 for interpretation purposes and label the factors as follows: assertive (Factor 1) and defensive (Factor 2).\n\nBoth factors have negative loadings on analytic thinking. This provides strong support that analytic indicates a more formal and analytical style with minimal audience engagement, while identified factors represent highly narrative, less technical and less factual writing styles. Factor 1 is based on positive emotional tone and clout, highlighting social connections and accomplishments with the use of optimistic narratives, which we refer to as assertive. Factor 2 is balanced communication (e.g., neutral loading of emotional tone) with high use of cognitive processes markers that cautiously provide explanation and meaning to organizational outcomes, which we refer to as defensive. Within Factor 2, the loadings suggest that this style provides complex meanings, justifications and explanations for organizational events while avoiding strong emotional bias. To ensure accurate factor labeling and strengthen the\n\n11\nrobustness of our",
        "Conclusions": "conclusions, we additionally account for the correlations between the factor variables and linguistic style and content variables\u2077. We present our correlation analysis in Table IV.\n\n--- [Insert Table IV about here] ---\n\nNotably, we find that readability\u2078 positively correlates with assertive and defensive styles but negatively correlates with the formal-analytical style. These results suggest that contrary to the obfuscation-through-low-readability hypothesis proposed in prior studies, more explicit rhetorical IM tends to rely on simpler, understandable language. Further, in acknowledging the diverse interpretations and classifications within the field of IM, it is important to note that the terms \u201cassertive\u201d and \u201cdefensive\u201d encompass a broad spectrum of subcategories in the literature, including enhancements, entitlements, excuses and justifications (Tedeschi and Melburg, 1984). In our investigation, as indicated by correlations observed, the assertive category is notably associated with what might be considered enhancements, portraying an overly optimistic perspective, while the defensive category aligns more with justifications or the act of sensemaking and rationalizing the communicated content.\n\n## 4.4. Empirical models\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we apply the following regression model:\n\nRhetorical style = f(INDsen, ESGcontro, INDsen X ESGcontr, controls)\n\nThe dependent variable allows for three different rhetorical styles. The first is represented by the analytical thinking variable, which loads highly negatively on the assertive and defensive factors in the factor analysis and stands for formal-analytical language use. This somewhat detached and impersonal rhetorical approach stresses logical and rational information structuring and low CEO interference to guide the audience to a preferred mindset. The other two dependent variables are derived from our factor analysis: an assertive style (Factor 1); and a defensive rhetorical approach (Factor 2). The latter two variables correspond to writing styles that are predominantly narrative and include storytelling and explicit IM elements (emotional, personal and cognitive language).\n\nThe first variable of interest (INDsen), being a dummy variable that indicates a company\u2019s membership in sensitive industries, captures general visibility (H1 and H3). In defining the variable, we follow prior literature (Garcia et al., 2017; Passetti et al., 2018) and consider materials (including chemicals, metals &amp; mining, forestry-paper &amp; wood products), oil &amp; gas and utilities as sensitive industries (dummy variable is coded one for those industries)\u2079. The second variable of interest (ESGcontro) is the ESG controversies score as a proxy for issue visibility (H2 and H3). The score is calculated by Refinitiv based on 23 ESG controversy topics and is captured from global media (third-party sourced information) that materially impact the corporations. The score allows comparison across industries and resolves the market cap bias, which large companies suffer from, as they attract more media attention than smaller companies through adjusting and normalizing scores based on company size and\n\n\u2077 Style variables are derived from LIWC-22; whereas content variables are based on the CSR dictionary developed by Pencle and Malaescu (2016), which encompasses dimensions related to employee, human rights, environment, and social and community.\n\n\u2078 FOG Readability Index is calculated as: -1 x 0.4 x (average words per sentence + percentage of complex words). In our study, higher FOG index values indicate more readable CEO letters.\n\n\u2079 We acknowledge that all companies in all industrial sectors can conduct activities with potential implications for the environment and society. Our selection of sustainability-sensitive industries includes the industries with the major socio-environmental impact, following prior literature.\n\n12\nindustry (Shakil, 2021). The controversies score is expressed as a percentage rank, where a higher score implies fewer controversies. For a more straightforward interpretation, we reverse-coded the controversies score (i.e., presence of controversies is equal to 1; and no controversies is equal to 0). To test the industry moderation effect (H3) we include the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro.\n\nOur models also include a number of control variables. To account for the interplay between sections of the report (CEO letter versus main report), we add the following two general disclosure transparency variables. First, we use a GRI dummy variable indicating whether the company follows the GRI standards/guidelines in its disclosure process. While the implementation of GRI may suggest greater transparency (Graafland and Smid, 2019), empirical evidence indicates that given the voluntary character of the framework, it is often used in a symbolic manner (Boiral, 2013; Michelon et al., 2015). Hence, we introduce Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score (DIStransparency) as a second transparency-related control variable, widely used in prior literature as a proxy for corporate transparency and accountability in sustainability (Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2022). Bloomberg's analysts track companies' disclosure on more than 800 environmental, social and governance metrics, both qualitative and quantitative. The score ranges from 0.1 for companies that disclose a minimum amount of ESG data to 100 for those that disclose every data point collected by Bloomberg. The score is comparable across sectors and regions.\n\nFurther, as prior literature indicates, companies can simultaneously be involved in sustainability controversies while demonstrating strong social and environmental performance in other areas (Price and Sun, 2017), which may lead to differing effects on corporate disclosure behavior (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). Hence, we control for the mean of Refinitiv's environmental and social scores as the proxy for overall environmental and social performance (EnvSoc) (Ioannou and Serafeim, 2012). Additionally, to control for organizational characteristics mechanisms that may influence IM behavior we employ corporate governance variables including an assurance dummy variable (Assur) indicating whether a company's report was subject to external verification, CSR/sustainability committee (CSRcom), percentage of female directors on board (BRDwmn), board size (BRDsize), percentage of independent board directors (BRDind) and CEO duality (CEOdual). As firm-level financial controls, we use ROA as a proxy of a company's profitability, and the natural logarithm of total assets as an indicator of the company's size (Size). Consistent with established literature on the country-level institutional determinants of IM (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Liu and Liu, 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020), we also incorporate regional dummy variables (UK and US) to control for company location. Finally, we control for the time trend including year dummies in the model. Table V summarizes our variables.\n\n--- [Insert Table V about here] ---\n\nThe hypotheses are tested using random effects models that allowed us to estimate the effects of our time-invariant variable of interest (INDsen). The choice of the model was supported by the results of the Mundlak tests (Mundlak, 1978). For assertive and defensive as explained variables tests showed: Chi-squared(12) = 18.01, Prob &gt; Chi-squared = .113; Chi-squared(13) = 20.91, Prob &gt; Chi-squared = .052, respectively. These results indicate that there is no correlation between time-invariant unobservables and regressors, hence we reject the null hypotheses and conclude that the random effects models apply.\n\n13\n14\n\n# 5. Results\n\n## 5.1. Descriptive statistics\n\nTable VI provides descriptive statistics to present the overall characteristics of the companies included in the sample. 38% of our observations come from sensitive industries. The mean value for the ESG controversy score is 0.22. While the majority (76%) of the firms adhere to GRI standards, only about half of them were subject to independent assurance and the mean value of disclosure transparency (DIStransparency) among these firms is 47.01. With regard to corporate governance practices, the majority of the sample companies have CSR/sustainability committees at the board level, as well as CEO and Chairman of the Board separation. The sample companies reveal variation in terms of board size (with a mean of 11 members), independence (with 75% of independent directors on average) and board gender diversity (with 23% female board members on average). Performance statistics reveal a mean of 66.43 for EnvSoc and of 5.51 for ROA. The sample companies are quite similar though with respect to size, with a mean and standard deviation of company size of 23.44 and 1.44, respectively\u00b9\u2070.\n\n--- [Insert Table VI about here] ---\n\nTable VII presents a correlation matrix. We note that membership in sensitive industries (INDsen) is negatively correlated with two identified rhetorical IM profiles (assertive and defensive), while positively correlated with the formal-analytical style (Analytic), which provides initial support for our hypotheses (H1a and H1b). Correlation analysis also indicates that our issue visibility variable (ESGcontro) is positively correlated with defensive IM and negatively with formal-analytical style. These results provide support for our expectation regarding the prominence of defensive IM (H2a), but not for our hypothesis on the relationship between issue visibility and assertive IM (H2b). Moreover, sensitive industry membership is positively correlated with the use of GRI and overall disclosure transparency, suggesting that companies in sensitive industries value accountability and transparency to sustain legitimacy. The correlations among our independent variables do not indicate multicollinearity.\n\n--- [Insert Table VII about here] ---\n\n## 5.2. Multivariate analysis\n\nThe results based on the empirical models are reported in Table VIII. In the first three models, we tested the direct relationship (i.e., main effect) between our dependent and test variables (excluding the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro). Model (1) shows that, in line with our expectations (H1a), companies operating in sensitive industries disclose more formal and analytical SR CEO letters (i.e., significantly positive coefficient for INDsen - b = -.019, p &lt; 0.10). Model (2) documents a significantly negative relationship between INDsen and the assertive style (b = -.029, p &lt; 0.05). The results could indicate that the effect of general visibility pertains only to assertive IM and provide partial support for our hypothesis (H1b). We further\n\n\u00b9\u2070 The sample exhibits a bias towards larger firms, resulting in limited variation in terms of firm size. This observation further supports the argument that firm size should not be used as a proxy for general visibility.\nnote a significantly positive relationship between ESG controversies (ESGcontro) and defensive style in SR CEO letters (Model (3)), providing support for H2a. H2b is, however, not supported, as we observe no significant relationship between ESG controversies score and assertive IM (Model (2)).\n\n--- [Insert Table VIII about here] ---\n\nIn Models (4) up to (6), we added the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro to test the hypotheses regarding the moderating effect (H3a and H3b). The results indicate a significantly positive interaction effect for the defensive style (Model (6)), that supports our H3a. The lack of a statistically significant coefficient on ESGcontro in Model 6 suggests that it is companies from sensitive industries that are more prone to resort to defensive IM when controversies arise. Figure 1 depicts that the positive relationship between ESGcontro and defensiveness is observed only in sensitive industries, while it remains insignificant (indicated by a flat line) in non-sensitive industries. We find no statistically significant interaction effect in Model (5) (H3b was not supported).\n\n--- [Insert Figure 1 about here] ---\n\nRegarding our transparency-related control variables, our results show a positive effect of the DIStransparency on the use of formal-analytical style (b = .0013, p &lt; 0.01) and a negative effect on the assertive style (b = -.0012, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, our findings indicate a negative relationship between formal-analytical style and GRI (b = -.0192, p &lt; 0.5) and a positive association between assertive style and the use of these reporting standards (b = .0211, p &lt; 0.5). With respect to the corporate governance controls, assertive style seems to be constrained in the presence of larger boards (b = -.0058, p &lt; 0.01) and CSR committee (b = -.0192, p &lt; 0.1). Firms with larger representation of women on board tend to use less formal-analytical (b = -.0007, p &lt; 0.05) and more defensive language (0.0010, p&lt;0.01). Finally, both region dummies (UK and US) move in the same direction in comparison with the EU institutional setting for formal-analytical and assertive styles, that is both UK and US negatively affect the use of formal-analytical style (b = -.0707; b = -.0625, p &lt; 0.01); while positively affect the use of assertive style (b = .0522; b = .1272, p &lt; 0.01). Regarding the defensive style, however, we observe a significant effect from the UK companies (b = .0496, p &lt; 0.01), whereas no significant effect is noted from the US companies; yet both of the effects are in the same direction. According to Matten and Moon's (2008) perspective, these discrepancies could be associated with unique institutional arrangements at the regional level. Matten and Moon's (2008) implicit-explicit CSR framework suggests that both US- and UK-oriented CSR tends to be more explicit in comparison to the European-style CSR, which provides more room for corporate initiative and therefore both assertive and defensive IM. The prominence of active private investors with a short-term outlook and shareholder value oriented institutional investors in the Anglo-Saxon countries would increase awareness for and salience of public image and tend to encourage IM.\n\nAs our results show, companies operating in sensitive industries tend to use a more formal-analytical style in the SR CEO letters. Such language is rather formal, logical, and hierarchically structured in terms of how information is presented and tends to avoid the need to focus on people and actions. This suggests that the greater scrutiny and governance pressures\n\n15\nin those industries, compel management to present their sustainability efforts in a more structured, somewhat detached and low-risk manner. Similarly, there is a significant negative relationship between operating in sensitive industries and assertive storytelling style. Whereas CEOs in non-sensitive industries tend to invest in authoritative, confident and outward-facing language that reflects leadership, certainty and being in control through assertive storytelling, such tendencies are significantly lower in sensitive industries. This indicates a more cautious approach in sensitive industries, probably to avoid backlash or skepticism from stakeholders. However, the significantly positive interaction effect for the defensive style indicates that companies operating in sensitive industries are more likely to adopt a defensive stance when facing high levels of ESG controversies. So, when the company is directly faced with mediatized sustainability controversies, the CEO tends to take the stage to explain, make sense or contextualize the issues involved in a more reactive fashion, probably to protect the company's legitimacy and mitigate potential negative perceptions. Our results also suggest that as general disclosure transparency increases, CEOs are less inclined to take on an assertive posture of leadership and control. Instead, they increasingly rely on formal, low-risk information sharing (i.e., analytic). Opposite results are found for GRI-based reports, which might suggest a largely symbolic function of this voluntary disclosure framework.\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of our findings against potential bias due to the skewed distribution of ESGcontro $^{11}$ , we re-estimate our primary models for the subsample of observations with reported ESG controversies (ESGcontro&gt;0). The results (Table IX) show that the direct effect of sensitive industry membership (INDsen) and ESG controversies (ESGcontro) yield the same sign, yet the statistical significance decreases (and even disappears) for some of the previously observed effects (so in Models (1) and (3)). When the interaction term is included (Models (4) and (6)), coefficients do attain statistical significance (which is in line with the main analyses). We associate the decrease in significance levels with the smaller sample size used for the robustness check. Nevertheless, the results of the robustness check qualitatively support our primary findings.\n\n--- [Insert Table IX about here] --\n\n# 6. Discussion and conclusion\n\nCEO narratives are a powerful tool to shape public perception of a company's sustainability track record and of its alignment with societal norms and values. A SR CEO letter holds considerable leeway in highlighting key messages and themes, while the body of the report offers substantiation with more detailed information, data, and context, often in concert with institutionalized reporting formats. Prior research documents that CEO letters tend to be used for legitimacy purposes, portraying the company in a favorable light and giving the impression of acting in accordance with social expectations. Although promotional by nature, the CEO letter also needs to incorporate language that suggests transparency, accountability, and a commitment to sustainability to maintain alignment with societal expectations. This study\ninvestigates how balancing these needs is affected by corporate visibility driven by sensitive industry membership and mediatized controversies.\n\nOur paper shows that higher general visibility from sensitive industry membership with its stronger scrutiny pressures leads to a more formal and analytical language style. Avoiding explicit rhetorical IM that is typically permeated with emotional, personal and story-telling language, reflects a restrained and risk-averse communication approach that may serve as a safeguard against potential backlash from stakeholders. This caution is evident in companies operating in sensitive industries, where the risk of being seen as merely window-dressing environmental efforts is higher. While these results are consistent with findings of previous studies (e.g., Marquis et al., 2016, Ruiz-Blanco et al., 2021), we only observe an impact of general visibility on the use of assertive IM, and not on defensive IM. This indicates that both forms of rhetorical IM follow different internal logic and connect with different drivers.\n\nOur results suggest that managers allow themselves to be assertive only when they are not afraid of being accused of \"greenwashing\". Companies with a lower environmental footprint face less scrutiny and activist pressure (Marquis et al., 2016) and seem less constrained by public knowledge to profile themselves and take up an assertive stance in portraying leadership and authority in the sustainability domain as a way to establish legitimacy (Tan et al., 2014). Such outward-facing and authoritative communication allows CEOs to demonstrate confidence and control. While assertiveness is typically proactive, defensiveness is reactive and would not be consistent with an aura of confident agency and leadership. As demonstrated, defensive IM is only triggered when corporate legitimacy is overtly challenged. O'Donovan (2002) argues that the legitimation techniques chosen depend on whether the company is trying to maintain the current level of legitimacy or repair damaged legitimacy. Controversies disrupt a company's legitimacy status, rapidly attract media attention through news and social media, and increase the discrepancy between the desired and current image of the company (DasGupta, 2021; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992). This break in the legitimacy status-quo motivates CEOs to use defensive IM strategies to mitigate reputational and regulatory risks. Our findings show that in the face of a legitimacy threat, CEOs resort to sense-giving mechanisms in a more conversational style, probably in an effort to contextualize and normalize. The highly discretionary nature of the CEO letter makes it more suited to react to controversies than the main report would allow. Defensive rhetorical IM is primarily in play for companies in highly visible, sensitive industries. These companies are exceptionally vulnerable to reputational damage from mediatized sustainability controversies. Any negative event is likely to be amplified by media attention and public outrage. CEOs of these companies are under immense pressure to address the controversies head-on in their letters. They cannot simply ignore them or offer formal or vague statements but need to step in reactively to address and clarify the issues involved. As Tata and Prasad (2015) predict, the relationship between a legitimacy gap and the organization's motivation to close it through sustainability communication will be stronger under high levels of media attention and public scrutiny, which is supported by our findings.\n\nContrary to our expectations, there is no empirical evidence to substantiate a negative relationship between sustainability controversies and assertive IM. It suggests that assertive and defensive language (and formal and analytical language for that matter) are not mutually exclusive as they respond to different triggers. CEO letters may contain both assertive and defensive components with assertiveness being more pervasive and long-term than reactive language. In the same vein, CEO letters have both an analytic and a narrative component, but they are likely to differ on a continuum along which information-structural language versus story-driving language is used, depending on context (of which general visibility and issue visibility shows to be an important ingredient).\n\n17\nOur study adds to the literature in several respects. Our methodological approach offers a more fine-grained focus on linguistic features in SR CEO letters and extends the existing body of research, which predominantly depends on qualitative methods involving small sample sizes and/or does not differentiate between reporting genres within SR. First, our analysis allows us to disentangle different forms of rhetorical IM management, their mutual interactions and their underlying drivers, highlighting how they are triggered by distinct legitimacy concerns. Ultimately, the study enriches our understanding of how CEOs navigate the complex terrain of sustainability communication to manage public perception and balance highly context-dependent legitimacy needs.\n\nSecond, in contrast to prior literature that identifies low readability as an IM strategy (e.g., Li et al., 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018), we corroborate that both assertive and defensive IM styles tend to be more readable than a formal-analytical style. Higher readability will facilitate the accessibility of the key messages and, thus, their persuasive potential. This is consistent with the rhetorical intent of the assertive and defensive style patterns: they can only be persuasive and effective in changing impressions to the extent that they are accessible and understandable by the main audience of the CEO letter. In contrast, formal and analytical language, though probably more precise and objective, tends to be more complex and technical, which burdens readability as measured by the traditional readability formulae. Our findings suggest that readability is rather the outcome of more refined linguistic style choices than a direct IM tool.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis also reveals an interesting interdependency between the CEO letter and the main report. The empirical models show that changes in the CEO narratives with respect to language style occur in concert with the transparency of the disclosure environment. Formal-analytical language, prevalent in CEO letters of companies operating in sensitive industries, is highly impersonal and descriptive and creates a sense of objectivity and helps to establish a professional tone. It is in line with the language of accountability and transparency that permeates the main report. This suggests close alignment of the CEO letter with the main reporting outlet which, in itself, already tends to be of higher quality for sensitive industries. The relatively high information threshold of the main report may act as a constraint on promotional postures. Formally and logically aligning with what is already there in the main report seems to be the pragmatic way for CEOs in sensitive industries to maintain credibility and legitimacy. Moreover, interestingly, with respect to GRI, we observe a shift from an assertive style towards more formal and analytical language in SR that does not follow GRI guidelines. While CEOs tend to communicate in an authoritative and optimistic manner in reports prepared according to GRI, their language becomes more cautious when the report is not standard-based. This observation aligns with studies suggesting that the GRI framework may not necessarily guarantee high transparency of disclosures. Instead, it is often employed as a symbolic practice (Michelon et al., 2015; Roszkowska-Menkes et al., 2024) and, as our findings show, can be complemented by an assertive IM in the CEO letter.\n\nFinally, although not explicitly hypothesized, our findings corroborate strong region-based effects on style features of the CEO letter. CEOs from the US and UK companies typically face a more active and demanding investor environment and may have stronger power-related and pecuniary incentives to engage in active IM. In addition, the more explicit CSR environment in which these companies operate (Moon and Matten, 2008), allows more room for corporate initiative to link sustainability issues with company-level identity and reputation (Blindheim, 2015). In our data, this translates into a significant positive effect on rhetorical IM and a negative effect on formal-analytical style. This could suggest that the CEO letter in these countries is typically motivated to cater to a shareholder perspective on the company's sustainability track record.\n\n18\nWith respect to practical implications, our empirical exploration of the rhetorical IM in SR along with the identification of instances of the use of formal-analytical style and IM provides valuable insights for policymakers. This investigation enhances understanding of how CEO rhetorics is related to transparency in sustainability-related information and accountability within SR. In addition, our research is expected to help investors and analysts assess companies and the credibility of their corporate communication, which can eventually shape socially responsible investor behaviors and contribute to developing a more effective governance and regulation system in the realm of SR. This is particularly important in light of the increasing financial relevance of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Our results may also be of interest to investors and financial analysts, as assertive rhetorical IM in financial CEO letters has been shown to be negatively related to the dispersion of financial analysts' earnings forecasts and positively to earnings forecast accuracy (Yan et al., 2019).\n\nA major limitation of our study is the availability of SR of companies. The reliance on databases is insufficient, necessitating a considerable amount of time in the manual data collection process. This constraint led to a reduction in the number of disclosures included in the analysis. As a result, our sample size did not permit, for instance, a more detailed examination of the impact of the institutional environment, including nuanced distinctions between the varieties of capitalism present in Continental Europe (Pinto et al., 2019). Additionally, with the increasing use of integrated reporting (\"IR\") framework, both sustainability and financial information are combined. Yet, our sample is based on \"SR only\" to allow for a clear focus on IM strategies in sustainability-related information. Moreover, with our analysis identifying interdependencies between the CEO letter and the main body of the sustainability report, further empirical research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of how increased transparency may discipline CEO IM, particularly in light of the increasing efforts and convergence among standard-setting institutions, including the IFRS Foundation, EFRAG, and GSSB, to develop integrated and globally aligned SR standards. Lastly, the language used in CEO letters to convey personalized messages can largely be influenced by the author's characteristics, including gender and personality traits (Liu and Nguyen, 2020; Le Maux and Smaili, 2024). While this topic remains beyond the scope of our study, we encourage future research to examine how the interplay between organizational visibility and CEO characteristics affects IM in SR.\n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, future studies should explore and shed light on the factors and policies affecting accountability in SR and the influence of corporate governance factors that may restrict managers' use of SR as a symbolic legitimacy tool. We emphasize that continued efforts are needed to make SR more accountable and transparent. In final words, we would like to refer to Patten (2019): \"Legitimacy-based research can help move CSR disclosure at least closer to being a tool of accountability, as opposed to a tool for legitimation\".\n\n## Reference List\n\nAerts, W., Cheng, P., and Tarca, A.

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\n\nIn response to growing concerns about the credibility of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, this study examines the relationship between external assurance on CSR reports and CSR decoupling. Specifically, we explore how combinations of the level and scope of assurance, and the type of assurance provider are associated with a reduction in CSR decoupling. Using an international sample of publicly listed firms, we find that CSR decoupling is significantly reduced when firms obtain reasonable assurance together with either a broad assurance scope or an assurance provider from the auditing profession. These results suggest that reasonable assurance provides a necessary foundation for reducing CSR decoupling, but its effectiveness is contingent on its combination with either a broad assurance scope or an assurance provider from the auditing profession. This highlights the importance of comprehensive CSR assurance practices in meaningfully addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance, whereas CSR assurance practices that meet only the minimum standards primarily serve a symbolic role, enhancing legitimacy. We discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers and investors.\n\n# 1 |",
        "Introduction": "Introduction\n\nThis study examines the relationship between external assurance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and CSR decoupling. In response to growing pressures from investors and other stakeholders to become more accountable for the impacts of their activities on the environment and society, companies are expected\u2014or even legally obliged\u2014to enhance transparency. Although they increasingly disclose information on CSR performance (Lin et al. 2024), stakeholders remain concerned about CSR decoupling. Prior literature defines CSR decoupling as \u201ca symbolic strategy whereby firms overstate their CSR performance in their disclosures to strengthen their legitimacy\u201d (Tashman et al. 2019, 154; see also Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022;\n\nSauerwald and Su 2019). Companies may use CSR decoupling as a strategic tool to shape stakeholders' perceptions by communicating CSR actions that are not matched by substantive efforts (Hawn and Ioannou 2016; Marquis et al. 2016; Cho and Patten 2007).\n\nTo address increasing concerns from investors and other stakeholders about the credibility and reliability of the CSR information presented in CSR reports, CSR assurance serves as an external monitoring mechanism to enhance stakeholders' confidence in the credibility of the CSR information disclosed (Adams and Evans 2004; Brown-Liburd and Zamora 2015; Du and Wu 2019). For companies, obtaining external assurance signals that their reported CSR performance is fairly presented\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

In parallel, policymakers have increasingly integrated assurance requirements into CSR disclosure regulations to improve the credibility of reported information at a systemic level. For instance, the EU has adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which initially mandates limited assurance for CSR disclosures. Similarly, other jurisdictions, such as South Africa, have introduced assurance obligations for CSR information (Ackers and Eccles 2015). However, both in voluntary and mandatory settings, CSR assurance may vary considerably in terms of the level and scope of assurance, and the choice of the assurance provider. The level of assurance ranges from reasonable assurance to limited assurance, and the scope of assurance may cover the entire report or be limited to specific sections. For an independent assurance provider, companies can choose assurance providers from either the auditing profession or non-auditing professions.\n\nIn voluntary settings, managers from companies with poor CSR performance facing public pressures and legitimacy threats may strategically benefit from less comprehensive assurance practices (i.e. limited instead of reasonable assurance and a narrower scope of assurance) to proactively shape stakeholders' perceptions of the credibility of the CSR information disclosed, while deflecting attention from poor CSR performance (Unerman 2008; O'Dwyer et al. 2011; Perego and Kolk 2012). They may exercise their managerial discretion to primarily use CSR assurance as a self-serving risk management tool to enhance external legitimacy and corporate reputation through symbolic communication about their CSR actions in CSR reports, without being adequately supported by substantive CSR actions (Bothello et al. 2023; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022; Bromley and Powell 2012; Marquis et al. 2016; Velte 2021). Such practices raise doubts about the actual effectiveness of CSR assurance in reducing CSR decoupling and in enhancing the transparency and decision-usefulness of CSR reports for investors and other stakeholders (Boiral et al. 2019; Talbot and Boiral 2018; Michelon et al. 2015).\n\nIn mandatory settings, policymakers face important cost--benefit trade-offs when determining the appropriate level and scope of assurance in disclosure regulations (Leuz and Wysocki 2016; Christensen et al. 2021). These trade-offs have recently become evident in the EU Omnibus discussions (European Commission 2025), which ultimately led to the abandonment of the initially ambitious goal of requiring reasonable assurance for CSR disclosures aimed at elevating their quality to the level of financial reporting for all firms subject to the CSRD. To assess and evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure regulations in enhancing CSR reporting quality and credibility, it is important to develop a deeper understanding of how variations in CSR assurance choices may relate to variations in CSR decoupling. Specifically, the influence of combinations of CSR assurance choices on CSR decoupling remains underexplored (Aboud et al. 2024).\n\nIn this study, we aim to enhance understanding of the relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. To this end, we examine how combinations of assurance level, assurance scope, and the type of assurance provider are associated with reductions in CSR decoupling. Using a unique international panel dataset of publicly listed firms from 2010 to 2022, the results show that reductions in CSR decoupling are significantly negatively associated with the combination of reasonable assurance and a broad scope of assurance, as well as with reasonable assurance and providers from the auditing profession. This highlights the importance of comprehensive assurance practices in meaningfully addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance.\n\nOur study contributes to ongoing research on the effectiveness of CSR assurance in enhancing CSR reporting quality by being among the first to systematically examine how combinations of CSR assurance choices relate to CSR decoupling (Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022; Braam and Peeters 2018; Hodge et al. 2009). The findings indicate that the CSR assurance process can help reduce CSR decoupling when reasonable assurance is combined with a broad scope or when reasonable assurance is provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession. They suggest that adopting a CSR assurance approach that exceeds the minimum standards, particularly through combinations involving reasonable assurance, can have synergistic effects in mitigating CSR decoupling.\n\nHowever, the findings show no significant relationships between reductions in CSR decoupling and combinations of limited assurance and other assurance-related choices, indicating that limited assurance is not effective in mitigating CSR decoupling. Instead, our findings suggest that limited assurance primarily serves a symbolic function, enhancing perceived legitimacy, stakeholder trust, and corporate reputation while having little effect on reducing CSR decoupling, and may even contribute to its increase. These findings have important implications for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. From a cost--benefit perspective, the findings are policy-relevant as they inform policymakers about the potential benefits of a comprehensive assurance approach to improving the quality of CSR reporting. Additionally, they help investors and other stakeholders better understand the role of CSR assurance in enhancing the credibility of CSR reports.\n\n##",
        "2 Theoretical Background and Development of Hypotheses": "2 Theoretical Background and Development of Hypotheses\n\nCSR assurance should ensure that the information disclosed in CSR reports is, in all material respects, reliable and accurate, in compliance with reporting standards, and, for this reason, verifiable. It should signal the credibility of corporate CSR disclosures, enhance stakeholders' confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the information disclosed (Brown-Liburd et al. 2018; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022). The process of independent assurance can encourage companies to strengthen their risk management systems, enhance the stakeholders' engagement processes, and improve their accounting systems and reporting practices, enabling them to produce and disclose more reliable and accurate CSR information (Michelon et al. 2015; Braam and Peeters 2018). This, in turn, helps lessen the gap between CSR disclosures and actual performance (Sauerwald and Su 2019), improves\nthe quality of CSR reporting (Ballou et al. 2018; Moroney et al. 2012; Sethi et al. 2017), and fosters greater transparency (Christensen 2016; Christensen et al. 2021). Consistently, Sauerwald and Su (2019) find that CSR assurance reduces CSR decoupling, while Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2022) report a negative but non-significant relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. Furthermore, improved reporting processes and disclosure of higher quality CSR information may strengthen companies' commitment to sustainability and drive sustainable value creation, which may positively influence corporate reputation (Simnett et al. 2009; Pflugrath et al. 2011; Reimsbach et al. 2017; Odriozola and Baraibar-Diez 2017) and companies' competitive position (Lozano and Huisingh 2011; Marin et al. 2012; Lozano 2015).\n\nHowever, managers of companies have flexibility in choices related to CSR assurance. Managerial capture, which refers to management's control over CSR reporting and assurance processes (O'Dwyer 2003; O'Dwyer and Owen 2005; Michelon et al. 2015), allows managers to strategically exercise control and discretion in making choices related to the level and scope of assurance, as well as the choice for an assurance provider. In this study, we posit that companies with low levels of CSR decoupling are expected to make different choices related to the level and scope of CSR assurance and the assurance provider to distinguish themselves from companies with high levels of CSR decoupling. Reasonable (positive) assurance offers a higher level of assurance and requires an assurance provider to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to conclude that the disclosed CSR information is free from material misstatements. It more likely enhances the credibility and reliability of CSR disclosures for stakeholders than limited (negative) assurance. In terms of scope, assuring the entire CSR report signals a stronger commitment to transparency and accountability in CSR practices than a limited scope. While a restricted scope may draw attention to specific sections, it can also raise concerns about the company's overall transparency and integrity in its CSR efforts.\n\nCombinations of reasonable assurance and broad scope provide higher overall assurance levels and are expected to be more effective in reducing CSR decoupling. They involve greater scrutiny than limited assurance or assurance restricted to specific sections (Moroney et al. 2012), decrease the likelihood that management will selectively highlight favorable CSR performance while omitting less favorable aspects (Cho et al. 2012), and are more likely to signal that the CSR information is fairly presented, in all material respects. However, they are also costly signals. According to signaling theory, companies will trade off the relative costs and benefits of different assurance combinations and employ combinations only if the expected benefits outweigh the costs (Connelly et al. 2011; Hahn and Reimsbach 2021). The marginal expected benefits of credibly signaling lower levels of CSR decoupling through \u2018high-quality' assurance choices are more likely to outweigh the associated incremental costs for companies with low levels of CSR decoupling than for those with high CSR decoupling. Particularly for large firms that attract much public attention and scrutiny, the expected benefits of enhanced stakeholder confidence in the credibility of the CSR information disclosed may likely outweigh the higher costs, including the increased CSR assurance expenses (Braam and Peeters 2018; Fonseca 2010). In addition, these \u2018high-quality' assurance choices are challenging for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling to imitate (Clarkson et al. 2008; Pflugrath et al. 2011; e.g. Connelly et al. 2011).\n\nLegitimacy theory, however, suggests that companies exhibiting high levels of CSR decoupling may also benefit from CSR assurance, especially when faced with public pressure and legitimacy threats. Specifically, these companies are more likely to choose \u201clow-quality\u201d assurance choices, that is, limited assurance and a narrow scope, resulting in less scrutiny and greater flexibility to decouple reported CSR performance from actual practices. Through these strategic assurance choices, managers can signal the credibility and reliability of their CSR disclosures while simultaneously masking high levels of CSR decoupling. As a result, for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling, CSR assurance can actively help manage stakeholders' confidence in the company's commitment to sustainable development (Schons and Steinmeier 2016). Strategic CSR assurance choices can help to divert attention from unfavorable CSR performance, while at the same time enhancing perceived legitimacy and corporate reputation (Hahn and L\u00fclfs 2014; Michelon et al. 2015; Roszkowska-Menkes et al. 2024).\n\nWe expect that companies with low levels of CSR decoupling are more likely to select combinations of reasonable assurance and a broader scope to differentiate themselves from companies with high levels of CSR decoupling. Combinations of \u201chigh-quality\u201d assurance choices are costly signals but provide strategic benefits for companies with low levels of CSR decoupling because they are difficult for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling to imitate. In particular, for large firms that attract much public attention and scrutiny, the marginal expected benefits of credibly signaling lower levels of CSR decoupling are likely to outweigh the associated marginal costs of using these combinations. In contrast, companies with high levels of CSR decoupling may strategically use combinations of the \u201clow-quality assurance choices\u201d, that is, limited assurance with a narrow scope, to signal credibility while simultaneously obscuring the extent of their CSR decoupling. Accordingly, we state the following hypotheses:\n\n### Hypothesis 1.\n\nCompanies that combine a reasonable level of assurance with a broad scope of assurance on their CSR reports exhibit less CSR decoupling than companies lacking either or both of these assurance choices.\n\nFollowing prior literature, we distinguish between assurance providers from the auditing profession and other independent providers, such as sustainability or environmental consulting firms (Velte 2021; Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero and Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez 2018; Sethi et al. 2017). The auditing profession has experience and developed auditing standards, a body of ethics, independence and ethical requirements, that is, generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), and quality control mechanisms to provide high-quality independent assurance. Unlike other independent service providers, who are not required to comply with GAAP, having to follow GAAPs ensures a higher and more consistent quality of assurance for CSR reports, which enhances stakeholder trust. Auditing firms also have a reputation on which they rely on for the continuation of their business. For these reasons, some literature argues that assurance provided by auditing firms, on average, is of a higher quality than that provided by\nspecialist consultants (Hodge et al. 2009; Pflugrath et al. 2011; Zorio et al. 2013).\n\nMoreover, studies indicate that assurance providers from the auditing profession tend to charge higher fees than non-auditing providers (e.g. Simnett et al. 2009). This is consistent with the literature suggesting that fees may serve as a proxy for the level of audit effort (Hoitash et al. 2007). In this context, assurance providers from the auditing profession, on average, are likely to signal a higher level of audit effort on CSR reports than their non-audit counterparts (Dalla Via and Perego 2020). As a result, they are expected to be more effective in reducing CSR decoupling, enhancing credibility, and shaping stakeholders' perceptions of the reliability of the information disclosed in CSR reports. A counterargument, however, is that non-auditing assurance providers, such as environmental or sustainability consultancies, may possess more specialized expertise (Velte 2021; Martinez-Ferrero et al. 2018) and may adopt a different focus compared to traditional auditors (O'Dwyer and Owen 2005). Assurance providers within the auditing profession, however, can acquire this specialized knowledge (Simnett et al. 2009; Casey and Grenier 2015).\n\nWhen considering CSR assurance combinations that include the choice of an assurance provider, the arguments become less straightforward. For both companies with high and low levels of CSR decoupling, selecting an assurance provider from the auditing profession may offer benefits. For companies with low levels of CSR decoupling, an assurance provider from the auditing profession can strengthen the effects of a CSR assurance approach that provides a reasonable level of assurance and/or a broad scope, thereby enhancing the credibility of their CSR disclosures. Conversely, for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling, an assurance provider from the auditing profession can also strengthen the effectiveness of \u201clow-quality\u201d assurance options, building legitimacy and facilitating stakeholder trust.\n\nTaken together, given that assurance providers from the auditing profession have well-established, high-quality assurance processes and rely on their reputation\u2014to a higher extent than non-auditing assurors\u2014we state the following hypothesis:\n\n### Hypothesis 2.\n\nCompanies with a reasonable level of assurance on their CSR reports provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession exhibit less CSR decoupling compared to companies lacking either or both of these assurance choices.\n\n### Hypothesis 3.\n\nCompanies with a broad scope of assurance on their CSR reports provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession exhibit less CSR decoupling compared to companies lacking either or both of these assurance choices.\n\n##",
        "Research Method": "Research Method\n\n### Sample\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we first extracted data on nonfinancial information from the Sustainability Disclosure Database, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and LSEG Workspace. When non-financial information was not available in these databases, CSR reports were retrieved directly from the companies' websites to gather the missing data. We then merged this data with financial data provided by LSEG Workspace Datastream. Our final dataset contains 4299 firm-year observations in 843 unique publicly listed firms across 29 different countries in the period 2010--2022.\n\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for these firms. Panel A reports the distribution of the sample firms across countries and industries. Almost half of the firms are from the United Kingdom and United States, which are both shareholder-oriented countries; data coverage is, in general, large. However, we also cover smaller countries, containing two to eight firms. Panel B presents the distribution of CSR assurance choices across industries and shows the distribution of CSR assurance choices across sectors, with the manufacturing sector accounting for 43% of observations. Panel C shows the distribution of CSR assurance choices by year for the subsample of firms with CSR assurance.\n\n### Variables\n\n### CSR Decoupling\n\nTo measure our dependent variable CSR decoupling (CSR DECOUPLING), we follow the approach of Hawn and Ioannou (2016), who\u2014using raw data points from the Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database (currently part of the ESG database in LSEG Workspace)\u2014differentiated between external and internal CSR actions. Actions were classified as external CSR actions if they \u201c[...] appeared to be more externally oriented in terms of disclosure (e.g. reporting) and claims [...],\u201d while internal actions were those \u201c[...] that were more internally oriented in terms of policies [...]\u201d (Hawn and Ioannou 2016, 2577). Following Hawn and Ioannou (2016), we first measured external and internal actions per firm per year as the equally-weighted average of the normalized performance scores of internal actions and external actions, respectively. However, in our study, we make use of the LSEG database, where not all data points used to construct the original 24 external and 21 internal actions remain available. Where necessary, we substituted missing data with adapted measures or the most appropriate available proxies. Additionally, we omitted two external actions to avoid potential duplication with variables already included in our model as independent and control variables. The indices were then normalized, resulting in annual firm-level measures ranging from 0 to 1. Following Hawn and Ioannou (2016), CSR decoupling was calculated as the difference between the external normalized score in year t and the internal normalized score in year t - 1, where higher values indicate more CSR decoupling. Because larger companies are expected to have higher levels of internal and external CSR actions, we also applied a scaled measure for CSR decoupling. Consistent with Hawn and Ioannou (2016), this size-adjusted, relative measure of CSR decoupling was calculated as the ratio of CSR decoupling to the natural logarithm of total assets. This approach aligns with prior studies that also applied a scaled measures of CSR performance and disclosure (AlTuwaijri et al. 2004; Cho and Patten 2007; Clarkson et al. 2008; Braam et al. 2016).\nTABLE 1 | Descriptive statistics for sample firms (2009-2022).\n\nPanel A.

PROVIDER takes the value of 1 if the assurance provider is a member of the auditing profession, and 0 if the assurance is not provided by a member of the auditing profession (Simnett et al. 2009; Sethi et al. 2017; Martinez-Ferrero et al. 2018).\n\n# 3.2.3 | Control Variables\n\nAt the firm level, consistent with prior studies, we included size (SIZE) measured as the natural logarithm of total assets,\n\nleverage (LEVERAGE) defined as the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, return on assets (ROA) measured as the return-on-assets ratio (Ruiz-Blanco et al. 2022; Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2022; Sauerwald and Su 2019), and other firm-specific characteristics (Tashman et al. 2019; Marquis et al. 2016). For non-financial performance, we used the ESG score (ESG) provided by the ESG database from LSEG Workspace Datastream, which reflects a company's combined performance across the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars. Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D), defined as the expenses in research and development divided by the total sales (Tashman et al. 2019), was added as a proxy for a firm's innovation ability. To overcome the common issue of missing data on firms' R&amp;D expenses, we followed Tashman et al. (2019) by using industry averages as a proxy for missing data. Capital intensity (CAPITAL INTENSITY), measured as the ratio of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets (Marquis et al. 2016;\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 2025\nTABLE 2 | Variable definitions.\n\n|  Dependent variables  |   |\n| --- | --- |\n|  CSR DECOUPLINGit | Calculated as the difference between the external normalized score in year t and the internal normalized score in year t-1 for firm i in year t. Higher values indicate more CSR decoupling.  |\n|  SCALED CSR DECOUPLINGit | Relative, size-adjusted measure of CSR decoupling calculated as the ratio of CSR decoupling to the natural logarithm of total assets for firm i in year t.  |\n|  Independent variables  |   |\n|  CSR ASSURANCEit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the sustainability report of firm i in year t was assured by an independent CSR assurance provider, and 0 otherwise.  |\n|  LEVELit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if reasonable assurance was provided for the sustainability report of firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise, that is, limited assurance.  |\n|  SCOPEit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the scope of the independent assurance provided covers the entire sustainability report of firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise.  |\n|  PROVIDERit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the assurance provider of firm i in year t is a member of the auditing profession, and 0 if the assurance is not provided by an accounting firm (Simnett et al. 2009).  |\n|  Control variables at firm and country level  |   |\n|  SIZEit | Natural logarithm of the company i's year-end total assets.  |\n|  LEVERAGEit | Total debt for firm i in year t, measured as a percentage of total assets.  |\n|  ROAit-1 | Return on assets for firm i in year t-1, measured as net income divided by total assets.  |\n|  ESGit | Combined ESG score for firm i in year t, based on the reported information in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars as obtained from the ESG database in LSEG Workspace.  |\n|  R&Dit | Proxy for innovation, measured as the expenses in research and development divided by total sales for firm i in year t (Tashman et al. 2019).  |\n|  CAPITAL INTENSITYit | Ratio of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets for firm i in year t (Marquis et al. 2016; Tashman et al. 2019).  |\n|  DISCLOSURE REGULATIONit | Dummy variable coded as 1 if a company i in year t has to comply with mandatory CSR disclosure regulation (Krueger et al. 2024), and 0 other wise.  |\n|  STAKEHOLDER ORIENTATIONi | Dummy variable coded as 1 if a company i is headquartered in a stakeholder-oriented country, and 0 if a company i is headquartered in a shareholder-oriented or other country.  |\n\nTashman et al. 2019), was included because capital-intensive firms typically have greater financial resources, which may influence their approach to CSR initiatives and assurance practices. In addition, we controlled for whether firms were subject to mandatory CSR disclosure regulations (Krueger et al. 2024).\n\nTo control for sector-specific effects, we controlled for industry differences based on a categorization of industries with the use of the two-digit SIC codes (Industry dummies). To account for country-level effects, we distinguished between companies that were headquartered in a stakeholder-oriented versus shareholder-oriented and other countries (Ballou et al. 2018; Braam and Peeters 2018; Simnett et al. 2009). Table 2\n\nsummarizes the definitions of the dependent, explanatory, and control variables used in our analyses. Table 3 presents the summary statistics for these variables.\n\n# 3.3 | Research Model\n\nWe tested our hypotheses using multilevel mixed-effects linear panel data regression analyses as our panel data set has a multilevel structure with repeated measurements at the firm level that are nested within countries. This approach accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and mitigates the risk of heteroscedasticity (Lindner et al. 2021). To test Hypotheses 1-3, we used the following model:\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 2025\nTABLE 3 | Summary statistics.\n\n|  Panel A.

We used one-year lagged effects for the CSR assurance-related choices as the influence of the CSR assurance practices might not immediately affect CSR decoupling, and thus approach causality. To\n\naccount for the fact that the lagged effects of CSR assurance-related options on CSR decoupling may vary depending on the presence of the other assurance-related choices, we examined the interaction effects between different assurance-related choices. Finally, our panel data analysis incorporated year fixed effects to control for time effects and random effects at both the firm and country levels to control for variations across firms and countries. The Pearson's $r$ correlations shown in Panel B of Table 3 as well as the variance inflation factors (unreported) suggest no multicollinearity.\n\n##",

These results provide strong support for Hypothesis 1, indicating that companies providing a reasonable level of assurance combined with a broad scope of assurance on their CSR reports exhibit less CSR decoupling than companies lacking one or both of these assurance characteristics. The findings suggest that the combination of reasonable assurance with a broad assurance scope can have synergistic effects in reducing CSR decoupling.\n\nModels 2 and 4 in both Panels also reveal that the interactions between the lagged effects of LEVEL and PROVIDER are significantly and negatively related to CSR decoupling. These results provide strong support for Hypothesis 2, indicating that companies combining a reasonable level of assurance with assurance provided by the auditing profession exhibit lower levels of CSR decoupling.\n\nFinally, Model 4 in Panel A and Models 2 and 4 in Panel B show significant positive interactions between SCOPE and PROVIDER and CSR decoupling, while Model 2 in Panel A shows a positive but non-significant association.

Specifically, the findings in Panel B suggest that among companies with CSR assurance on their reports, those with limited assurance, a broad assurance scope, and an assurance provider from the auditing profession exhibit higher levels of CSR decoupling.\n\nTogether, these results suggest that CSR assurance practices that exceed minimum standards, particularly those involving reasonable assurance, can play a significant role in mitigating CSR decoupling. The findings suggest that CSR assurance can conditionally contribute to mitigating CSR decoupling and enhance the quality of CSR reports. Specifically, the findings indicate that the assurance process enhances the quality of CSR reports when a reasonable level of assurance is combined with a broad scope or assurance providers from the auditing profession.\n\n## Robustness\n\nThe results in Table 4 show that using the alternative measures of CSR decoupling does not change our main results, suggesting that the findings are robust across different measures of CSR decoupling. In addition, we investigated whether cross-country variation measures may affect the results. For this reason, we also estimated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions with country, industry, and year fixed effects and firm-level clustered and heteroscedasticity-adjusted standard errors. Table 5 presents the results of these additional analyses, which qualitatively align with our main analysis in Table 4, indicating that the findings are robust to different measures of country effects.\n\nMoreover, Table 1 shows that the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) are highly represented in our data set with 26% and 22% of observations, respectively, while some other countries in the sample are rather small. To ensure that our results are not influenced by the inclusion (or exclusion) of the UK or the US, or by observations from countries that are very small, as additional robustness tests, we recursively repeated our main analyses after eliminating the UK, the US, one at a time, or the small country samples containing less than 15 firm-year observations from the analysis. Table 6 reports the results of these additional analyses for the main results. The results are consistent with the main results in Table 4, indicating that the results are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of specific countries with the larger or smaller country samples.\n\nTable 7 shows the results when also including the three-way interaction between LEVEL, SCOPE, and PROVIDER. The findings of this additional analysis show that the results are mostly robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the three-way interaction. Finally, even though we use time-fixed effects in our settings, we test whether the Covid pandemic drives our main results by dropping the Covid years 2020 and 2021 from our sample. The untabulated results show that our main findings stay qualitatively the same after dropping the Covid years. Overall, as none of the robustness tests change our general results, we are confident that our results are qualitatively robust.\n\n##",
        "Conclusions": "Conclusions and Discussion\n\nThis study examined the relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. Specifically, we explored how the combinations of the level and scope of assurance and the type of assurance provider are associated with a reduction in CSR decoupling. Our findings indicate that CSR assurance can mitigate CSR decoupling when reasonable assurance is combined with a broad scope or when reasonable assurance is provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession. They highlight the importance of comprehensive assurance practices in effectively addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance, and in substantively enhancing the quality of CSR reports. However, for companies that meet only the minimum assurance standards, our results suggest that CSR assurance primarily serves a symbolic role, enhancing perceived legitimacy while having little effect on reduction, or even potentially increasing CSR decoupling. Legitimacy theory explains these latter findings by suggesting that managers of companies use CSR assurance as a self-serving tool for risk and impression management to proactively shape stakeholders' perceptions of the credibility of the CSR information disclosed, enhance perceived company legitimacy, and build stakeholder trust (Talbot and Boiral 2018; Braam and Peeters 2018; O'Dwyer et al. 2011).\n\nOur results have important implications for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. From a policy perspective, they suggest that policymakers should strengthen mandatory CSR assurance requirements to enhance the quality of corporate sustainability reporting. Under the CSRD, companies are currently mandated to obtain limited assurance (European Commission 2025). However, our findings indicate that limited assurance\u2014regardless of its scope or whether it is provided by\na practitioner from the auditing profession\u2014does not reduce CSR decoupling, nor does it increase the likelihood that CSR disclosures are fairly presented and free from material misstatements. Specifically, the results suggest that limited assurance\u2014whether mandatory or voluntary\u2014may primarily serve a symbolic rather than substantive role, as its actual impact on the quality and reliability of CSR disclosures appears limited. Accordingly, the decision of EU policymakers to drop the ambitious goal to implement reasonable assurance of CSR information under the Omnibus regulation raises concerns that, despite growing societal demands for corporate accountability and transparency regarding CSR performance and corporate impact on society and the environment, limited assurance may produce unintended adverse effects (Aboud et al. 2024). However, such an approach entails substantial costs and implementation challenges, which lie beyond the scope of this study.\n\nOur findings can further be helpful for investors and other stakeholders in assessing the credibility and reliability of the CSR information presented in CSR reports. Our findings suggest that CSR assurance is not \"automatically\" associated with management's commitment to credible CSR disclosures, increased transparency, and a higher CSR reporting quality (Michelon et al. 2015).\n\nFinally, our study has certain limitations, including those related to the potential influence of unobservable factors that may affect CSR assurance and CSR decoupling, potentially leading to endogeneity issues. Although we have included different measures of CSR decoupling and conducted several robustness tests, future studies could further investigate the conditions under which CSR assurance enhances or inhibits the development of higher-quality CSR reporting and increased transparency, ultimately facilitating more responsible business practices. Additionally, future studies could examine the cost implications of CSR assurance, including those related to the assurance level, scope, and the choice of assurance provider to advance our understanding of the consequences of regulating CSR assurance.\n\n# Endnotes\n\n1. The decision to retain limited assurance, rather than transitioning to the more extensive and costly reasonable assurance, was motivated by the EU's aim to reduce compliance costs and administrative burdens. Moreover, limited assurance provides companies with greater flexibility by enabling adaptability to emerging issues without the rigidity of formal standards, and by placing greater emphasis on materiality assessments.\n2. Enhanced stakeholder confidence in the credibility of disclosed CSR information may result in competitive advantages, including improved access to finance (Cheng et al. 2014), lower cost of equity capital (Dhaliwal et al. 2011; Martinez-Ferrero and Garcia-Sanchez 2017), increased analyst coverage, lower analyst forecast errors, lower monitoring costs (Dhaliwal et al. 2012; Casey and Grenier 2015), and higher future cash flows (Lys et al. 2015; Plumlee et al. 2015).\n3. In their article, Hawn and Ioannou (2016) referred to the online version of Appendix S1, titled \"The Composition of Internal and External Actions' Indices\". Appendix S1 provides the complete list of the 24 external and 21 internal actions, and enables an exact replication of their classification and measurement approach. The two omitted external actions are: (13) \"Is the company's CSR report published in accordance with the GRI guidelines?\" and (22) \"Does the company have an external auditor of its CSR/H&amp;S/Sustainability report?\".\n\n#",
