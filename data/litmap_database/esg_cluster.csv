Purpose
This study aims to study the response of the stock market to the announcement of compulsory environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure regulation in the context of the Indian economy – one of the largest emerging economies. The study also examines the role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure.


Design/methodology/approach
Daily stock price data of 940 listed companies has been collected for 276 trading days to compute abnormal returns. The current study is based on event study methodology to analyze the announcement effect of disclosure regulations. Furthermore, to check the robustness of results, cross-sectional regression has been applied to correct for potential heterogeneity.


Findings
Results of the event study signify that the equity share market has reacted positively and significantly to the mandatory ESG disclosure regulation. Furthermore, the study also confirms the mitigating role of carbon sensitivity and pre-ESG disclosure as carbon nonsensitive (non predisclosure) firms have witnessed a more intense effect of regulation as compared to sensitive (predisclosed) corporations.


Practical implications
Current findings assist managers in understanding investor perception toward nonfinancial disclosures. Corporate managers can use disclosure as a tool to enhance the firm value and reduce information asymmetry by providing relevant information. Furthermore, policymakers can use the findings of present research to disseminate the advantages of adopting ESG disclosure practices thereby improving the transparency and governance among business firms.


Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to provide empirical evidence on the market response to compulsory ESG disclosure framework in the emerging context of India. Furthermore, considering the infancy stage of ESG research, the present research contributes to the body of knowledge by empirically testing the disclosure theories.

Current ESG rating systems lack transparency in incorporating China’s unique industrial, economic, and cultural factors, creating reliability concerns for stakeholders managing supply chain sustainability risks. This study develops an explainable artificial intelligence framework using SHAP and permutation feature importance (PFI) methods to predict the ESG performance of Chinese firms. We analyze comprehensive ESG data of 1608 Chinese listed companies over 13 years (2009–2021), integrating financial and non-financial determinants traditionally examined in isolation. Empirical findings demonstrate that random forest algorithms significantly outperform multivariate linear regression in capturing nonlinear ESG relationships. Key non-financial determinants include patent portfolios, CSR training initiatives, pollutant emissions, and charitable donations, while financial factors such as current assets and gearing ratios prove influential. Sectoral analysis reveals that manufacturing firms are evaluated through pollutant emissions and technical capabilities, whereas non-manufacturing firms are assessed on business taxes and intangible assets. These insights provide essential tools for multinational corporations to anticipate supply chain sustainability conditions.",288950328,0,66,,

Stratified analysis revealed four groups of companies according to the average value of ROA and ROE indicators, as well as four classes according to the average ESG disclosure score. The analysis of GRI topics and materiality disclosure scores showed an average disclosure level on ESG components, located between a satisfactory and a good level of disclosure. Also, companies were found to be more inclined to disclose data on the sustainability strategy but provided poor and vague information on the business model. The results of comparative clustering analysis based on FinESG reporting and disclosure scores showed that 31.57% of companies maintained their position in the final ranking. Content analysis of sustainability reports by Leximancer, v.5.0 software highlighted that the most salient topic was “employees”, and it revealed correlations between the themes “employees” and “emissions”.

Motivation: In the context of the growing importance of sustainability reporting, understanding the link between ESG and firm performance is critical for informed and sustainable corporate strategies. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study employs panel data regression techniques on secondary data from 120 Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed firms between 2015 and 2020. Main Findings: Overall, the composite ESG scores do not significantly affect the financial performance of South African companies. However, scores from social and governance pillars show a positive association with firm performance, while environmental scores have a limited effect. Practical Implications/Managerial Impact: These findings suggest that not all ESG activities are equally relevant for firm profitability. Corporate managers should prioritise industry-relevant ESG pillars to enhance firm profitability. Novelty/Contribution: The study expands empirical evidence in an emerging market context, analysing the impact of disaggregated ESG scores and providing comparative industry-specific analysis.

Elangovan",Investment Management and Financial Innovations,2025,"With the increasing global emphasis on responsible investing, this study explores the tradeoff between ESG and traditional financial metrics in shaping the investment decisions of retail investors in India. A within-subject experimental design was employed at Christ University, India, involving an initial sample of 75 participants, with 55 completing all three experiment rounds. The sample respondents evaluated masked stock profiles across three rounds, where updated financial and ESG information on masked stock was provided at each round. The results indicate that though ESG metrics are getting attention among retail investors, financial metrics are still the main determining factor for investment. It was found that ROE (52 responses), 3-year CAGR Net Profit (36 responses), and P/E ratios (48 responses) are the most influencing factors to make investment decisions. Similarly, ESG factors (Governance, Environmental, and Sustainability scores) are also frequently mentioned, with 74 citations. Retail investors mainly consider profitability and view ESG as risk-mitigating or neutralizing factors. While evaluating the ESG factors, retailers mainly look at the firm’s environmental concerns, followed by governance and social factors. This result contrasts with the previous studies in this domain, where the literature emphasized governance factors more than environmental factors. These results highlight the integration of ESG elements, as retail investors remain with favorable returns and sacrifice sustainability. Further, this study spots the need for better and quantifiable ESG performance reports to consider alternative data comparable to financial data for better investment decisions.",284969996,3,47,,

Design/methodology/approach This study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating sentiment analysis, topic modeling, clustering, causal loop analysis and ethnography to examine ESG-related content on social media. Analyzing social media data, study identified key themes and derived ten propositions about ESG investing. Industry professionals, financial advisors and investors further validated these findings through expert interviews. Combining data-driven analysis and qualitative insights provides a comprehensive understanding of how social media shapes investor preferences and decision-making in the ESG domain. Findings Environmental aspects, such as conservation, preservation of natural resources, renewable and clean energy, biodiversity, restoration and eco-friendly products and technologies, shape attitudes toward ESG investing. Social considerations, including inclusivity, diversity, social justice, human rights, stakeholder engagement, transparency, community development and philanthropy, significantly influence ESG investing sentiments. Governance elements such as transparency, accountability, ethical governance, compliance, risk management, regulatory compliance and responsible leadership also play a pivotal role in shaping ESG investing opinions. Practical implications This study presents actionable insights for policymakers and organizations by identifying key constructs in ESG investing and proposing an integrated framework that includes mediating factors like resource efficiency and stakeholder engagement alongside moderating elements such as regulatory environment and investor preferences. Policymakers should establish standardized ESG reporting frameworks, incentivize sustainable practices and use social media data for regulatory purposes. For businesses, integrating social media insights into decision-making can enhance ESG communication strategies and accountability.

Key insights from the study underscore a positive association between business sophistication and ESG performance. This suggests that organizations leveraging advanced knowledge and innovation are better positioned to implement effective ESG strategies. Moreover, higher tax revenue is linked to better ESG, underlining a commitment to sustainability within the business landscape. Notably, Information, Communication, and Technology (ICT) emerges as a pivotal catalyst in augmenting ESG performance, particularly when integrated with business sophistication and tax revenue mechanisms. Technical summary This study examines the relationship between business sophistication, tax revenue policies, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance in 105 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries from 2013 to 2021, focusing on the moderating role of Information, Communication, and Technology (ICT). Using advanced econometric methods like Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and fixed-effect regression, the research also considers factors such as microfinance institutions, commercial bank financing, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal a significant positive link between business sophistication and ESG performance, indicating that companies with advanced knowledge and innovation are more likely to implement successful ESG policies. Higher tax revenue is also positively correlated with ESG improvements, reflecting support for sustainability. ICT is crucial in enhancing ESG performance, especially when combined with business sophistication and tax revenue. Microfinance and commercial banking are vital in promoting ESG practices in BRI countries. Despite a temporary decline in ESG performance due to COVID-19, the study predicts a post-pandemic resurgence, emphasizing the need to foster an innovation culture for sustainable development.

Current ESG rating systems lack transparency in incorporating China’s unique industrial, economic, and cultural factors, creating reliability concerns for stakeholders managing supply chain sustainability risks. This study develops an explainable artificial intelligence framework using SHAP and permutation feature importance (PFI) methods to predict the ESG performance of Chinese firms. We analyze comprehensive ESG data of 1608 Chinese listed companies over 13 years (2009–2021), integrating financial and non-financial determinants traditionally examined in isolation. Empirical findings demonstrate that random forest algorithms significantly outperform multivariate linear regression in capturing nonlinear ESG relationships. Key non-financial determinants include patent portfolios, CSR training initiatives, pollutant emissions, and charitable donations, while financial factors such as current assets and gearing ratios prove influential. Sectoral analysis reveals that manufacturing firms are evaluated through pollutant emissions and technical capabilities, whereas non-manufacturing firms are assessed on business taxes and intangible assets. These insights provide essential tools for multinational corporations to anticipate supply chain sustainability conditions.",288950328,0,66,,

Within this landscape falls the present study that aimed to examine the quality of ESG reporting connected to the financial performance of listed companies. Stratified analysis revealed four groups of companies according to the average value of ROA and ROE indicators, as well as four classes according to the average ESG disclosure score. The analysis of GRI topics and materiality disclosure scores showed an average disclosure level on ESG components, located between a satisfactory and a good level of disclosure. Also, companies were found to be more inclined to disclose data on the sustainability strategy but provided poor and vague information on the business model. The results of comparative clustering analysis based on FinESG reporting and disclosure scores showed that 31.57% of companies maintained their position in the final ranking. Content analysis of sustainability reports by Leximancer, v.5.0 software highlighted that the most salient topic was “employees”, and it revealed correlations between the themes “employees” and “emissions”.

Elangovan",Investment Management and Financial Innovations,2025,"With the increasing global emphasis on responsible investing, this study explores the tradeoff between ESG and traditional financial metrics in shaping the investment decisions of retail investors in India. A within-subject experimental design was employed at Christ University, India, involving an initial sample of 75 participants, with 55 completing all three experiment rounds. The sample respondents evaluated masked stock profiles across three rounds, where updated financial and ESG information on masked stock was provided at each round. The results indicate that though ESG metrics are getting attention among retail investors, financial metrics are still the main determining factor for investment. It was found that ROE (52 responses), 3-year CAGR Net Profit (36 responses), and P/E ratios (48 responses) are the most influencing factors to make investment decisions. Similarly, ESG factors (Governance, Environmental, and Sustainability scores) are also frequently mentioned, with 74 citations. Retail investors mainly consider profitability and view ESG as risk-mitigating or neutralizing factors. While evaluating the ESG factors, retailers mainly look at the firm’s environmental concerns, followed by governance and social factors. This result contrasts with the previous studies in this domain, where the literature emphasized governance factors more than environmental factors. These results highlight the integration of ESG elements, as retail investors remain with favorable returns and sacrifice sustainability. Further, this study spots the need for better and quantifiable ESG performance reports to consider alternative data comparable to financial data for better investment decisions.",284969996,3,47,,

 This paper aims to investigate whether and how different levels of digital financial literacy (DFL) foster sustainable investing.
 
 
 
 The authors use a large, representative sample of more than 5,000 Italian households (Edufin Report, 2023), representing individuals responsible for managing the family finances. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to assess respondents’ DFL, which reflects self-reported confidence in conducting financial transactions through digital devices. The paper adopts probit models to investigate the link between DFL and holding at least one sustainable asset in households’ portfolio while controlling for certain socio-demographic and behavioural variables.
 
 
 
 The results show that DFL has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of holding sustainable investments, but only among investors with advanced digital skills that enable them to manage sophisticated financial activities (e.g. investing or pension management). The results are robust to alternative measures of DFL and to endogeneity concerns. In particular, the most predictive measures of DFL relate to investors’ behaviours and attitudes towards, rather than awareness of, digital financial services. The behavioural dimension is further supported by the positive association between sustainable investment holding and self-assessed financial literacy, optimism and overconfidence.
 
 
 
 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to empirically connect DFL to sustainable investment holdings among individual investors. Building on previous insights on digitalisation and sustainability in the business context, this study identifies DFL as a critical enabler of households’ sustainable investments. This study provides new evidence on how promoting advanced digital skills can foster financial inclusion and support the uptake of environmental, social and governance investments among households.

In particular, the potential roles of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and blockchain (BC) in the ESG market have not been fully explored. Purpose of the article: This study explores the deep integration of digital technology and ESG by evaluating the correlation and spillover effects among AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices. Methods: This study explores the spillovers between AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices by cross-quantilogram and quantile time-frequency connectedness approaches. Findings &amp; value addition: The lower quantile of ESG returns has a weak positive (strong negative) correlation with the lower (upper) quantile of digital technology. Next, the spillover effects vary with time, frequency, and quantile levels. Meanwhile, the North America and Asia-Pacific developed ESG indices serve as the transmitter and receiver of spillover effects, respectively. Furthermore, the dependence between digital technology and ESG returns is insignificant before the COVID-19 crisis but increases after it. This quantile-dependent asymmetry fundamentally challenges linear assumptions prevalent in current ESG-technology integration theories. Overall, this study contributes by integrating AI, CC, BC, and ESG into a unified framework, and analyzing their interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, it dynamically analyzes the asymmetry over long and short-term horizons, and highlights the hedging role of digital technology in stabilizing ESG markets. Moreover, we provide novel insights about the interconnectedness between these markets, offering valuable guidance on risk management. Consequently, regulators should urgently explore the development of digital asset-based ESG derivatives as targeted risk mitigation tools. Positioned at the cutting-edge, this work sets a methodological benchmark for analyzing non-linear, frequency-sensitive interdependencies within the rapidly evolving ESG-digital nexus, transforming the theoretical framework from static linearities to dynamic non-linearities. Finally, this study proposes some reasonable suggestions, including raising risk awareness, promoting digital transformation, building integration and innovation platforms, and leveraging ESG’s diffusion role.",289701960,3,102,,

Drawing on panel data regression techniques, including fixed effects models with Driscoll–Kraay standard errors, pooled OLS with industry and year controls, and dynamic panel estimations using system GMM, the analysis reveals a significant and positive association between AI implementation and overall ESG scores. Disaggregated analysis shows that AI adoption is particularly associated with improvements in the environmental and social dimensions, with a more moderate relationship to governance practices. To address potential issues of cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity, the study applies the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) and Mean Group (MG) estimators as robustness checks, which confirm the consistency of the main findings. In addition, the Dumitrescu–Hurlin panel Granger causality test indicates that AI adoption Granger-causes ESG performance—especially in the environmental and social dimensions—while no reverse causality is observed. The results suggest that AI technologies are positively linked to firms’ sustainability strategies and performance, supporting the integration of digital transformation into national and corporate ESG agendas, particularly in emerging markets like Saudi Arabia.",292055068,4,47,,

While traditional ESG ratings had been widely used in responsible investment strategies, they often suffered from data inconsistency, subjectivity and limited coverage of unstructured sustainability information. AI-based ESG systems were increasingly applied to extract deeper sustainability signals from corporate disclosures, reports and external data sources. Using portfolio-level analysis, this study compared the financial outcomes of portfolios constructed using AI-driven ESG indicators with those based on conventional ESG ratings. The results showed that AI-enhanced high-ESG portfolios achieved higher mean returns and superior Sharpe ratios than both AI-based low-ESG portfolios and traditionally rated ESG portfolios. In addition, AI-driven high-ESG portfolios demonstrated lower downside-risk exposure and smaller maximum drawdowns during market stress, indicating stronger resilience. Regression analysis further revealed that AI-derived ESG scores were more strongly associated with excess returns than traditional ESG metrics. These findings suggested that AI improved the informational efficiency of ESG assessment by capturing more accurate, forward-looking sustainability risks and opportunities. The study concluded that AI-driven ESG analytics strengthened the financial relevance of sustainability integration and supported better-informed investment decision-making. The results carried important implications for investors, regulators and corporations seeking to align AI deployment with high-integrity sustainable finance practices, while also highlighting the need for ethical and transparent AI governance in financial markets.

Uncovering a Bidirectional Struggle in China’s Sustainable Finance,"Zizhe Du, Chao Chen",Sustainability,2025,"As global discourse increasingly centers on environmental, social, and governance considerations, ESG investment has become a major trend in financial markets. Artificial intelligence (AI), through its rapid evolution, has exerted a transformative influence that continues to reshape the fundamental structures of this domain. This study investigates the dynamic relationship between AI and ESG investment indices in China, aiming to reveal the bidirectional causal linkages and time-dependent interactions between these two critical areas. In methods, we used four different parameter stability tests to indicate that the Granger causality test based on the full-sample VAR model may produce biased results. Therefore, we employed a bootstrap rolling-window subsample Granger causality test using data from January 2013 to September 2024 in China. The results reveal a significant dynamic relationship between ESG investment and AI. In key findings, we find that AI exerts a negative impact on ESG investment. AI development attracts substantial capital inflows that favor technological advancement and commercialization over long-term ESG investments. Meanwhile, ESG investment shows both positive and negative effects on AI. The positive effect indicates that ESG investment promotes AI research and applications emphasizing energy efficiency, data privacy, and fairness, thereby supporting the sustainable development of AI technologies. However, driven by short-term economic returns, strict ESG standards and compliance requirements may, in the short term, constrain the development of certain energy-intensive or emerging AI technologies. In economic and political implications, our study provides policymakers with scientific evidence to improve the ESG investment environment and to design balanced policies that support both AI development and sustainable investment practices. It underscores the necessity of promoting coordinated development between AI and ESG investment to achieve global sustainability goals and recommends measures to align short-term economic interests with long-term ESG objectives. This study is expected to serve as a scientific basis for ESG goal-setting and contribute to the realization of China’s dual-carbon goals.

The goal of this paper is to determine how a set of common ESG elements, chosen from the viewpoints of sustainability and well-being, influence economic growth in the Western Balkan countries. For each ESG component, we used different variables. The information pertains to the five Western Balkan countries of North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia. Because of a lack of data, Kosovo is excluded from the study. Then, we compared results from the analysis of the Western Balkan countries with a set of countries in Southeast Europe, which are members of the European Union and essentially coincide with the Western Europe countries. We performed multiple regression analysis with applied fixed effects to the data model. According to the study’s findings, each of the independent variables had no significant impact on the GDP’s annual growth of the Western Balkan countries, but two of the variables, life expectancy at birth and labor force participation, have certain impact on the GDP growth of Southeast Europe countries, which are members of the European Union. The green transition has gained significant importance in the Western Balkan countries as a crucial pathway toward sustainable economic growth, though it introduces a range of new social and economic challenges.

It aims to explore how AI integration enhances the interpretability and predictive accuracy of ESG metrics in shaping market perceptions and investor decisions. This study employs a panel dataset from 2018 to 2024, analysing publicly listed non-financial firms across five major sectors: manufacturing, energy, telecommunications, consumer goods, and industrials. This study contributed by employing AI-powered multimodal analysis with conventional ESG scoring methods and integrating Fixed-Effects Regression with machine learning (ML) algorithms including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest to identify complex, non-linear relationships within ESG data and firm valuation. The results show empirical evidence that integrating ML enhances the explanatory power of ESG data. Findings indicate that ESG performance is positively correlated with higher market valuations, particularly in Environmental and Social dimensions. Governance metrics are more inconsistent, which may be due to heterogeneity in governance practices, regulatory enforcement and the challenges of quantifying governance quality beyond compliance indicators across the focus emerging markets. Firms identified in ESG controversies tend to face valuation penalties, which stresses market sensitivity to reputational risks. ML algorithms outperform conventional techniques in predictive accuracy, revealing complex, non-linear interactions within ESG data.

 This paper aims to investigate whether and how different levels of digital financial literacy (DFL) foster sustainable investing.
 
 
 
 The authors use a large, representative sample of more than 5,000 Italian households (Edufin Report, 2023), representing individuals responsible for managing the family finances. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to assess respondents’ DFL, which reflects self-reported confidence in conducting financial transactions through digital devices. The paper adopts probit models to investigate the link between DFL and holding at least one sustainable asset in households’ portfolio while controlling for certain socio-demographic and behavioural variables.
 
 
 
 The results show that DFL has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of holding sustainable investments, but only among investors with advanced digital skills that enable them to manage sophisticated financial activities (e.g. investing or pension management). The results are robust to alternative measures of DFL and to endogeneity concerns. In particular, the most predictive measures of DFL relate to investors’ behaviours and attitudes towards, rather than awareness of, digital financial services. The behavioural dimension is further supported by the positive association between sustainable investment holding and self-assessed financial literacy, optimism and overconfidence.
 
 
 
 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to empirically connect DFL to sustainable investment holdings among individual investors. Building on previous insights on digitalisation and sustainability in the business context, this study identifies DFL as a critical enabler of households’ sustainable investments. This study provides new evidence on how promoting advanced digital skills can foster financial inclusion and support the uptake of environmental, social and governance investments among households.

10.24136/oc.3629,"Digital revolution meets ESG: Can AI, blockchain and cloud computing enhance ESG performance?","Kai‐Hua Wang, Xue Jiang, Xin Li",Oeconomia Copernicana,2025,"Research background: In today’s digital age, traditional environmental, social, and governance (ESG) development paths are gradually facing challenges, including from digital technologies. In particular, the potential roles of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and blockchain (BC) in the ESG market have not been fully explored. Purpose of the article: This study explores the deep integration of digital technology and ESG by evaluating the correlation and spillover effects among AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices. Methods: This study explores the spillovers between AI, CC, BC, and eight global ESG indices by cross-quantilogram and quantile time-frequency connectedness approaches. Findings &amp; value addition: The lower quantile of ESG returns has a weak positive (strong negative) correlation with the lower (upper) quantile of digital technology. Next, the spillover effects vary with time, frequency, and quantile levels. Meanwhile, the North America and Asia-Pacific developed ESG indices serve as the transmitter and receiver of spillover effects, respectively. Furthermore, the dependence between digital technology and ESG returns is insignificant before the COVID-19 crisis but increases after it. This quantile-dependent asymmetry fundamentally challenges linear assumptions prevalent in current ESG-technology integration theories. Overall, this study contributes by integrating AI, CC, BC, and ESG into a unified framework, and analyzing their interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, it dynamically analyzes the asymmetry over long and short-term horizons, and highlights the hedging role of digital technology in stabilizing ESG markets. Moreover, we provide novel insights about the interconnectedness between these markets, offering valuable guidance on risk management. Consequently, regulators should urgently explore the development of digital asset-based ESG derivatives as targeted risk mitigation tools. Positioned at the cutting-edge, this work sets a methodological benchmark for analyzing non-linear, frequency-sensitive interdependencies within the rapidly evolving ESG-digital nexus, transforming the theoretical framework from static linearities to dynamic non-linearities. Finally, this study proposes some reasonable suggestions, including raising risk awareness, promoting digital transformation, building integration and innovation platforms, and leveraging ESG’s diffusion role.",289701960,3,102,,

While traditional ESG ratings had been widely used in responsible investment strategies, they often suffered from data inconsistency, subjectivity and limited coverage of unstructured sustainability information. AI-based ESG systems were increasingly applied to extract deeper sustainability signals from corporate disclosures, reports and external data sources. Using portfolio-level analysis, this study compared the financial outcomes of portfolios constructed using AI-driven ESG indicators with those based on conventional ESG ratings. The results showed that AI-enhanced high-ESG portfolios achieved higher mean returns and superior Sharpe ratios than both AI-based low-ESG portfolios and traditionally rated ESG portfolios. In addition, AI-driven high-ESG portfolios demonstrated lower downside-risk exposure and smaller maximum drawdowns during market stress, indicating stronger resilience. Regression analysis further revealed that AI-derived ESG scores were more strongly associated with excess returns than traditional ESG metrics. These findings suggested that AI improved the informational efficiency of ESG assessment by capturing more accurate, forward-looking sustainability risks and opportunities. The study concluded that AI-driven ESG analytics strengthened the financial relevance of sustainability integration and supported better-informed investment decision-making. The results carried important implications for investors, regulators and corporations seeking to align AI deployment with high-integrity sustainable finance practices, while also highlighting the need for ethical and transparent AI governance in financial markets.

Uncovering a Bidirectional Struggle in China’s Sustainable Finance,"Zizhe Du, Chao Chen",Sustainability,2025,"As global discourse increasingly centers on environmental, social, and governance considerations, ESG investment has become a major trend in financial markets. Artificial intelligence (AI), through its rapid evolution, has exerted a transformative influence that continues to reshape the fundamental structures of this domain. This study investigates the dynamic relationship between AI and ESG investment indices in China, aiming to reveal the bidirectional causal linkages and time-dependent interactions between these two critical areas. In methods, we used four different parameter stability tests to indicate that the Granger causality test based on the full-sample VAR model may produce biased results. Therefore, we employed a bootstrap rolling-window subsample Granger causality test using data from January 2013 to September 2024 in China. The results reveal a significant dynamic relationship between ESG investment and AI. In key findings, we find that AI exerts a negative impact on ESG investment. AI development attracts substantial capital inflows that favor technological advancement and commercialization over long-term ESG investments. Meanwhile, ESG investment shows both positive and negative effects on AI. The positive effect indicates that ESG investment promotes AI research and applications emphasizing energy efficiency, data privacy, and fairness, thereby supporting the sustainable development of AI technologies. However, driven by short-term economic returns, strict ESG standards and compliance requirements may, in the short term, constrain the development of certain energy-intensive or emerging AI technologies. In economic and political implications, our study provides policymakers with scientific evidence to improve the ESG investment environment and to design balanced policies that support both AI development and sustainable investment practices. It underscores the necessity of promoting coordinated development between AI and ESG investment to achieve global sustainability goals and recommends measures to align short-term economic interests with long-term ESG objectives. This study is expected to serve as a scientific basis for ESG goal-setting and contribute to the realization of China’s dual-carbon goals. In particular, it facilitates the convergence of artificial intelligence technologies with sustainable development initiatives and tells the importance of responsible technological progress for global sustainable development.",286899601,4,113,,

We performed multiple regression analysis with applied fixed effects to the data model. According to the study’s findings, each of the independent variables had no significant impact on the GDP’s annual growth of the Western Balkan countries, but two of the variables, life expectancy at birth and labor force participation, have certain impact on the GDP growth of Southeast Europe countries, which are members of the European Union. The green transition has gained significant importance in the Western Balkan countries as a crucial pathway toward sustainable economic growth, though it introduces a range of new social and economic challenges. Economically, these nations are confronted with considerable funding requirements for development. To build sustainable societies, it would be beneficial for these countries to explore more creative financing strategies. It is advised to establish financing frameworks that not only increase the transparency in policymaking but also ensure greater accountability in their execution.",278516563,14,29,,

It aims to explore how AI integration enhances the interpretability and predictive accuracy of ESG metrics in shaping market perceptions and investor decisions. This study employs a panel dataset from 2018 to 2024, analysing publicly listed non-financial firms across five major sectors: manufacturing, energy, telecommunications, consumer goods, and industrials. This study contributed by employing AI-powered multimodal analysis with conventional ESG scoring methods and integrating Fixed-Effects Regression with machine learning (ML) algorithms including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest to identify complex, non-linear relationships within ESG data and firm valuation. The results show empirical evidence that integrating ML enhances the explanatory power of ESG data. Findings indicate that ESG performance is positively correlated with higher market valuations, particularly in Environmental and Social dimensions. Governance metrics are more inconsistent, which may be due to heterogeneity in governance practices, regulatory enforcement and the challenges of quantifying governance quality beyond compliance indicators across the focus emerging markets. Firms identified in ESG controversies tend to face valuation penalties, which stresses market sensitivity to reputational risks. ML algorithms outperform conventional techniques in predictive accuracy, revealing complex, non-linear interactions within ESG data. This study contributes to both the academic literature and practice showing how next-generation ESG reporting can robust valuation models, address limitations of conventional ESG scoring, and ensure a reliable outlook for investors and policymakers of industries in emerging markets.",294184816,1,44,,

While past studies have explored this connection, they often faced challenges in quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of CSR initiatives. However, advancements in research methodologies and the development of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) measurement dimensions have led to the creation of more robust evaluation criteria. These criteria use ESG scores as primary reference indicators for assessing the effectiveness of CSR activities. This study aims to utilize ESG indicators from the ESG InfoHub website of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) as benchmarks, comprising 15 items from the environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) dimensions to form the CSR effectiveness indicators and predict financial performance. The data cover the years 2021–2022 for listed companies, using return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) as measures of financial performance. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, the applications of machine learning and deep learning (DL) have proliferated across many fields.

This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by examining the impact of green finance on environmental sustainability. Green finance development is represented by GDP, investment in renewable energy sources, investment in research and development (R&D) for eco-friendly projects, and public–private partnership investment in renewable energy projects. Green financing development in the chosen panel exhibits a distinct geographical cluster effect, with significant regional variances. The most important influencing elements are regional GDP, regional innovation level, and air quality, whereas the degree of financial development and industrial structure optimization are insignificant. The degree of financial development and industrial structure optimization are related to the amount of green finance development mostly via spillover effects. The degree of financial development has a positive spillover impact, but industrial structure optimization has a negative spillover effect. This study reveals that an increase in the production of energy from renewable sources, an increase in R&D, and the evolution of public–private partnership investment in renewable energy reduce CO2 emissions. It is evidenced that green finance in renewable energy sources is necessary to achieve environmental sustainability. There is a strong need to increase green finance in renewable sources to target the minimization of global CO2 emissions. There should be cross-border trade of renewable energy between regions/countries to mitigate CO2 emissions globally. Moreover, this study ranks the regions based on environmental sustainability, which may help researchers and decision-makers to entice foreign direct and private investment in these regions. The implications of the findings of the study suggest that environmental sustainability benefits greatly from green financing and investing in renewable energy sources through public–private partnerships, which represents one of the best ways to ensure environmental sustainability.",251330686,71,63,,

Chang, Muhammad Umar",Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja,2022,"Abstract This paper investigates how oil price (OP) influences the prospects of green bonds by utilising the quantile-onquantile (QQ) method and researching the interactions between OP and green bond index (GBI) from 2011:M1 to 2021:M11. We find that impacts from OP on the GBI are positive in the short run. The positive effects indicate that high OP can promote the development of the green bond market, indicating that green bonds can be considered an asset to avoid OP shocks. However, in the medium and long term, there is a negative impact due to the oversupply of the oil market and the increase in green energy industry profits. These results are identical to the supply and demand-based correlation model of green bonds and oil price, which underlines a specific effect of OP on GBI. The GBI effect on OP is consistently positive across all quantiles. It indicates that green bonds cannot be considered efficient measures to alleviate the oil crisis due to the instability of the Middle East COVID-19 and the small scale of green bonds. The issuers of green bonds can make decisions based on OP. Understanding the relationship between OP and GBI is also beneficial for investors.",64842793,64,130,,

Umut, Nilufar Ismailova, Zebo Kuldasheva",Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja,2022,"Abstract There are very few studies on the role of financial inclusion and energy efficiency in promoting a sustainable environment in the existing literature. These studies do not address or link financial inclusion to CO2 emissions in any way. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to look into the role of financial inclusion and energy efficiency on carbon emissions, as well as exports, imports, and gross domestic product (G.D.P.) in the BRICS economies from 1990 to 2020. The study additionally considers the panel data's integration, cointegration, cross-country interdependence, and heterogeneity features, resulting in reliable findings and well-founded policy recommendations. The panel Westerlund cointegration tests confirm the long-run relationships among CO2 emissions, financial inclusion, energy efficiency, exports, imports, and G.D.P. Furthermore, the long and short-run outcomes of CS-ARDL revealed that financial inclusion, imports size, and G.D.P. raise CO2 emissions, while energy efficiency and exports size reduce CO2 emissions. The study proposes increasing financial inclusion for controlling pollution and achieving sustainable environmental goals in light of these findings. Public-sector efforts are needed to integrate financial inclusion goals with continued improvements in energy efficiency and environmental policies.",11442382,62,90,,

It is even more important for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries because of their potential for economic growth and the challenge of their environmental problems. This paper therefore addresses the question of whether and how green finance (with the proxy of issued green bonds [GBs]) promotes energy efficiency (with the proxy of energy intensity) in the ASEAN member countries.Design/methodology/approachThe paper runs a two-stage generalized method of moments (GMM) system model for the quarterly data over the period 2017–2020. It also uses a linear interaction model to explore how the pandemic may affect the relationship between green finance and energy efficiency in this region.FindingsThe main results only demonstrate the short-term negative impact of GBs on energy intensity. Furthermore, per capita income, economic integration and renewable energy supply can be used as potential variables to reduce energy intensity, while modernization in ASEAN increases energy intensity. Establishment of digital green finance, long-term planning of a green finance market, trade liberalization and policies to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 are recommended as golden policy implications.Research limitations/implicationsThe present study has several limitations. First, it accounts for explanatory variables by following a number of previous studies. This may lead to omissions or errors. Second, the empirical estimates were conducted for 160 observations due to the repositioning of GBs in ASEAN, which is not bad but not good for an empirical study.Originality/valueTo the best of authors' knowledge, there has not been any in-depth study focusing on the relationship between energy efficiency and green financing for the case of ASEAN economies.",14842791,46,102,,

Like the other extensively growing industries, China's Film and Drama industries are responsible for contributing effectively toward a sustainable environment. In order to validate the same, this study has applied the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) technique, so as to identify the asymmetric association among the Film and Drama Industry, green innovation, and sustainable environment. The quarterly time-series data of the variables is assessed from January 2000 to December 2019. The outcomes of the study have revealed that the appreciation in the Film and Drama stock prices tends to increase the CO2 emissions. Whereas, the depreciation of the Film and Drama stock prices improves the efforts towards a sustainable environment. On the other hand, the increase in green innovation tends to have an adverse impact on environmental degradation, while the decline in green innovation tends to increase the carbon emissions. In order to handle the grievous problem of environmental degradation, caused by the Film and Drama industry of China, this study suggests that adopting green practices in Film and Drama making, such as green filming, the use of hybrid vehicles, LED lights, and solar generator supplies, and perhaps Computer-Generated Imagery sets will ultimately contribute towards the improvement of the quality of the environment.",95299321,38,79,,

Evidence from China,"Yijian Du, Guoming Hao, Honghui Zhu",Sustainability,2025,"Under the background of uncertainty brought by the rapid development of AI, participation in AI standardisation is becoming the key for strategic emerging enterprises (SEEs) to break through and achieve sustainable development. This paper selects listed SEEs from the China Strategic Emerging Industries Composite Index jointly issued by China Securities Index Co., Ltd. and the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2017 as the initial sample. We collect 3430 observations from 380 companies spanning 2010 to 2023. This paper employs a two-way fixed effects model incorporating enterprise clustering. It thoroughly investigates and empirically tests how participation in AI standardisation affects the sustainable development of SEEs under uncertainty. It is found that participation in AI standardisation in the context of uncertainty has a significant positive effect on the sustainable development of SEEs, and this conclusion still holds after employing instrumental variables, difference-in-difference, and a series of robustness tests. Mechanism tests indicate that two transmission paths exist between participation in AI standardisation and the sustainable development of SEEs under uncertainty: digital technology innovation and the dynamic capabilities in the dimensions of learning and absorption as well as change and reconfiguration. However, the dynamic capabilities in the coordination and integration dimensions do not play a significant mediating role. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that participation in AI standardisation contributes more significantly to the sustainable development of SEEs that are not state-owned, face lower environmental and information uncertainty, and are under higher economic policy uncertainty. The findings enrich the research related to AI standardisation and firm sustainability and provide policy recommendations for the sustainable development of SEEs in the context of uncertainty.",291171055,1,54,,

As the world faces mounting pressure to combat climate change, financial institutions and investors are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance sustainable investment strategies, assess environmental risks, and ensure transparency in green finance initiatives. This paper critically examines the role of AI in green financing, assessing whether it is a genuine catalyst for change or an overstated promise burdened by technological and regulatory limitations. AI-driven innovations are shaping green bond assessment, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scoring, carbon credit trading, and predictive climate risk modelling. These advancements highlight both opportunities and challenges in sustainable finance. AI's ability to process vast amounts of unstructured environmental data allows for improved decision-making. However, concerns regarding data bias, greenwashing, and the absence of standardised AI governance frameworks raise questions about its reliability and fairness. Machine learning models contribute to enhanced risk assessment and portfolio optimisation, yet regulatory inconsistencies and the opacity of AI decision-making processes often hinder their widespread adoption. Real world applications and case studies offer valuable insights into AI's effectiveness in driving green financial practices. Emerging trends, including AI-powered sustainability disclosures and blockchain-integrated AI systems, present promising solutions for greater transparency in green financing.

 This study addresses the challenges posed by interwoven complexities that expose businesses to ESG (environmental, social and governance) risks. Specifically, the study aims to investigate and provide mechanisms to effectively use COSO’s (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) guidance in managing ESG-related risks.
 
 
 
 This study adopts a “combined approach,” integrating reductionistic risk management (COSO’s ERM) and holistic sustainability perspectives (India’s BRSR–Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report). It developed a worldwide transferable ESG risk management mechanism based on COSO’s and WBCSD’s ERM guidance, GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and Integrated Reporting standards. It then applied to BRSR to create a country-specific performance assessment tool for ESG-related risk management. This tool, which categorizes 55 risk-relevant disclosures into ESG dimensions, has a four-point scale developed through sustainability-related content analysis. The study is validated with machine learning algorithms and experts’ opinions to enhance the robustness of the findings. The tool is operationalized on three Indian companies.
 
 
 
 The study’s findings reveal a gap in existing mechanisms for supporting the effective use of ERM in managing ESG-related risks. The two-folded mechanism demonstrates its applicability globally while offering a tailored solution for India through the BRSR system. Application of the developed tool to three real-world use cases showcases its practical effectiveness in addressing and mitigating ESG risks.
 
 
 
 This study offers a novel approach to assessing ESG-related risks. The two-folded mechanism adds originality to existing literature. Additionally, validating the “holistic and reductionistic” approach with machine learning algorithms enhances the originality and innovation of the study, providing a valuable resource for diverse stakeholders involved in decision-making related to ESG risks.

However, these documents are typically long, multimodal, and structurally complex, combining dense text, tables, figures, and layout-sensitive semantics. Existing AI systems often struggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no dedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we introduce MMESGBench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted to evaluate multimodal understanding and reasoning across multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a human-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates candidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting textual, tabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an LLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of each QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop validation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure quality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs derived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types and three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as single-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained multimodal evidence.

This study developed an AI dictionary using machine learning methods. Based on data from 3646 Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed A-share companies from 2011 to 2022 and a panel mediation effect model, the relationships between AI application, human capital structure adjustment, and corporate ESG performance were examined. Theoretical research suggests that when corporates adopt AI, demand for high-skilled labor will increase while some low-skilled positions will be replaced. This leads to optimization of the human capital structure, which in turn improves corporate ESG performance. The results of the mechanism examination show that enhancing corporate ESG performance through AI use is achieved by modifying the human capital structure. Analysis of heterogeneity finds that for non-state-owned, large-sized, and non-technology-intensive corporates, the impact of AI applications on corporate ESG performance is more pronounced.

To address this research gap, this study introduces the ""ESG Coupling Coordination Degree"" as a core evaluation metric to systematically investigate the mechanism through which the level of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and the degree of digital transformation influence corporate ESG coordinated development. Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2023, this research first constructs a coupling coordination degree model to measure the level of corporate ESG coordinated development and reveals its temporal evolution characteristics. The empirical results indicate that: the overall ESG coupling coordination degree of firms shows a steady upward trend, albeit with significant industry and regional disparities. Both the depth of digital transformation and the breadth of AI application exert a significant positive impact on corporate ESG coordinated development. This mechanism operates by enhancing the efficiency of internal information flows, which in turn promotes the balanced development of environmental management systems, social responsibility fulfillment, and corporate governance structures. Further analysis reveals that this synergistic effect is more pronounced in firms located in the eastern region and in technology-intensive industries, whereas firms with weaker digital infrastructure exhibit greater potential for improvement in ESG coordination. These findings provide empirical evidence and policy implications for policymakers aiming to foster the deep integration of the digital economy and sustainable development.",292411431,0,4,,
10.3390/systems13100916,Artificial Intelligence Empowerment and Carbon Emission Performance: A Systems Perspective on Sustainable Cleaner Production,"Shun Li, Ruijie Song, Sanggyun Na, Tingxian Yan",Systems,2025,"Amid China’s pursuit of its “dual carbon” goals, systematic theoretical and empirical research remains limited to the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing firms’ carbon emission performance (CEP). From a systems perspective, this study developed a dynamic learning game model that integrates a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function, an AI-enabled abatement function, and institutional constraints to analyze firms’ cleaner production and technology adoption under simultaneous budgetary and emission constraints. Empirically, we drew on panel data of 3404 Chinese A-share listed firms from 2013 to 2023 and employ a two-way fixed-effect model to examine the effect of AI empowerment on CEP. The results showed that AI significantly improves CEP overall, though its effect is potentially constrained by energy rebound effects. Robustness checks using alternative measures and specifications confirmed the reliability of the findings and further indicated that AI’s abatement effect became stronger after 2018, consistent with technological maturity and institutional improvement. Mechanism analysis suggests two plausible pathways: (1) improving ESG performance and strengthening environmental governance; and (2) stimulating green innovation to support low-carbon technology development and application. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that AI’s effects are more evident in regions with higher marketization, in private firms, and in non-pollution-intensive industries. By contrast, firms led by executives with overseas experience tend to exhibit weaker effects, a pattern consistent with institutional fit and localization considerations. This study contributes to cleaner production theory by highlighting firm-level mechanisms of AI-enabled carbon governance while offering practical insights for low-carbon transitions and digital decarbonization strategies in developing economies.",292131740,0,140,,

Drawing on the Resource-Based View and Contingency Theory, the study investigates whether accurate financial data reporting (AFDR) functions as a mechanism through which ISQMA contributes to sustainability outcomes, and whether the presence of AI and GCG strengthens these associations. Empirical data were collected from 257 accounting and finance professionals working in Jordanian commercial banks, providing a robust setting where digital infrastructure and sustainability imperatives converge. The results reveal that ISQMA is positively associated with both AFDR and CS, with AFDR partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, AI and GCG were found to strengthen the relationships between ISQMA and AFDR, and between ISQMA and CS, respectively. These findings underscore that accurate, reliable financial reporting, and strong governance practices enhance the value of digital information systems in achieving corporate sustainability objectives. By integrating information quality, technological capabilities, and governance mechanisms, this study offers a comprehensive understanding of how banks can align their digital infrastructure with sustainable performance goals. The insights contribute to the growing discourse on digitally enabled sustainability and offer actionable implications for both practitioners and policymakers in emerging markets.",288442843,4,130,,

10.3390/su17104717,"ESG Rating Divergence: Existence, Driving Factors, and Impact Effects","Yong Shi, Tongsheng Yao",Sustainability,2025,"In recent years, corporate ESG performance has been widely incorporated into investment decisions and capital allocation considerations, becoming a focal point and hot topic for research by governments and organizations worldwide. However, due to various reasons, significant discrepancies have emerged in ESG ratings for the same company across different institutions, and this growing divergence in ESG ratings has increasingly drawn the attention of scholars. Studying the differences in ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) ratings is of great significance. This not only helps to understand the root causes of differences, improve the objectivity, consistency, and comparability of ratings, but also helps users better understand the meaning and limitations of rating results. It is beneficial for investors to understand the focus of different ratings and develop more effective investment strategies. It can promote rated companies to improve the quality and transparency of ESG-related information disclosure. It can also provide a reference for regulatory agencies and policymakers, identify market failures and potential risks, and promote the development of more unified standards and frameworks. At the same time, this study can also promote the in-depth development of relevant academic research and theories. Based on this, this study systematically reviews the relevant literature on ESG rating divergence, focusing on its existence, causes, influencing factors, and impacts. The study finds that, in addition to the widespread existence of rating divergence in corporate ESG performance, scholars also disagree on the measurement and methods of this divergence. The reasons for rating divergence are mainly that ESG is a qualitative indicator; top-level design, intermediate calculations, and bottom-level data collection across multiple stages exacerbate divergence; and controversies in practice further deepen divergence, among others. The influencing factors and impact effects of ESG rating divergence are diverse. Given the existence of ESG rating divergence, all parties should treat ESG ratings with caution. This paper offers corresponding recommendations and looks forward to the future, providing a foundation for subsequent research.",287113590,16,104,,

The data has been checked for its stationarity by applying the Zivot and Andrews (ZA) unit root test, and the cointegration test results suggest a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables. The empirical finding of long-run estimates reveals that 1% augments of GI, GDP, and D&F industry increase CO2 emissions by −0.079, 0.566%, and 0.143%, respectively. Furthermore, the main results indicate that GDP and the D&F industry have statistically significant positive effects on CO2 emissions, and GI has statistically significant negative effects on CO2 emissions. The GI leads to lower environmental damage by reducing carbon emissions. Regarding causal relationships, bidirectional causality is found between D&F and CO2 emissions, GI and CO2 emissions.

For this, researchers and practitioners have always strived for viable solutions that are not just efficient in terms of their productivity, but are also innovative in nature, so that they have the least possible repercussions to the ecological wellbeing. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the relevancy of the rule of law and green innovation, while also ascertaining the economic growth among the top Asian countries from 1995 to 2018. Moreover, the relevancy of the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) is also validated by the help of the advanced and latest estimation techniques; specifically, the Cross-section augmented autoregressive distributed lags test (CS-ARDL). Based on the findings from the CS-ARDL, the rule of law, and the concept of green innovation have been reported to have a negative association with each other. Additionally, the EKC hypothesis is found to be legitimate and relevant as well. Based on the findings, creating awareness has been recommended for establishing the rule of law.

Abdul Moktadir, Jingzheng Ren",Sustainable Development,2023,"Tannery solid waste (TSW) management is vital for promoting sustainable development in the leather industry. However, sustainable management of TSW is challenging as it contains hazardous chemicals. Implementing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices can support managing TSW towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, it is not easy to implement ESG practices for TSW management since numerous challenges exist in the system. To assist TSW management through ESG implementation, it is imperative to investigate the interactions among challenges and mitigation strategies. However, the existing decision‐making models cannot deal with the uncertainty and vagueness on a border scale during interaction evaluation and alternatives ranking. Additionally, there is a shortage of scientific works on ESG practices in emerging economies. Therefore, this study, for the first time, offers an integrated novel Dombi t‐norm and Dombi t‐conorm grounded interval valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) Delphi, an extended IVFFSs‐weighted influence non‐liner Gause system (WINGS), and novel IVFFSs‐TODIM approach which is utterly lacking in the present literature. Also, the study offers a strategic roadmap to understand the interlinkage of findings with SDGs. The results of the IVFFSs‐WINGS analysis confirmed that the “Lack of solid waste management policy” is the most critical challenge for ESG implementation. Further, IVFFSs‐TODIM analysis confirmed that the “Policy development for TSW management complying with ESG and SDGs” is the top ESG challenges mitigation strategy for TSW management. The study's findings will provide guidance for government agencies, policymakers, and relevant stakeholders of the emerging economies tannery industry for successful implementation of ESG practices, thus helping to achieve SDGs.",266577335,15,73,,

In the baseline calibration of the model, which resembles the current state of the Spanish economy, this results in a 0.30% drop in GDP on impact. After increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix from 26% to 85%, in line with the 2050 targets for the Spanish economy, the same shock results in a 0.24% fall in GDP on impact, and the recovery is faster: the present discounted value of the full GDP response is reduced by 65%. The three main conclusions that we draw from this exercise are: i) an increase in the share of renewables makes the economy less vulnerable to shocks in international prices of brown energy inputs; ii) this vulnerability reduction is less than proportional: dividing the share of brown energy by approximately five only reduceds the size of the effects on GDP by between 21% and 65%; and iii) the main statistic that determines how much the vulnerability is reduced is not the share of brown energy inputs, but the degree to which final energy prices respond to the shock to brown energy prices.",275470919,15,77,,

Design/methodology/approach The present study is a panel data approach with a sample of the top 100 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)-listed non-financial firms covering the years 2019–2022. Appropriate panel data models have been used to investigate the association between ESG disclosure and financial performance, followed by an instrumental variable regression model to address endogeneity. Further, the panel data interaction effect model has been used to examine the moderating impact. Findings The results favour the value-enhancing function of ESG disclosure. Of the three ESG components, only the G factor affects firm performance significantly. The interaction effect model suggests that the link between ESG disclosure and financial performance is moderated by industry. However, this effect is greater for less sensitive industries. The results are robust to endogeneity. Originality/value The study’s novelty lies in the use of the integrated “Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics”, which has not been previously used in any study to assess the ESG disclosure of corporates.

The objective of this study is to identify the main environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators from the literature and analyze their impact on corporate company performances, as well as a conceptual structure that supports the understanding of these indicators. A systematic literature review was applied to raise and analyze relevant works in the field, following the guidelines of the Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). We identified and categorized the main indicators for each of the ESG dimensions, as well as the corporate performance (CP) variables impacted by ESG performance, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of their interrelations. Our results indicate that financial performance indicators must be assessed from a long-term perspective, as short-term analyses may show negative relationships with ESG performance. However, for nonfinancial aspects, the relationship with ESG performance is consistently positive across all time horizons. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework that advances the ESG literature by establishing explicit connections between ESG dimensions and corporate performance variables. This framework categorizes CP into four key areas—financial performance, market and risk perception, strategic positioning, and capital structure—providing a structured approach for evaluating ESG impacts.

Zariyawati",Business Strategy &amp; Development,2024,"Geopolitical risk (GPR) presents a profound challenge to firms, particularly in regions with persistent political instability. In Eastern Europe, where conflicts like the Russia–Ukraine war heighten uncertainty, firms face immediate financial threats and long‐term strategic vulnerabilities. This study examines the impact of GPR on firm performance, focusing on the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices as a resilience mechanism. Using a comprehensive dataset of 1360 publicly listed firms across Poland, Russia, and Ukraine from 2014 to 2023, the analysis employs a base panel data regression model, followed by a two‐step generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to account for endogeneity and ensure robustness. The findings reveal a significant negative relationship between GPR and firm performance, measured by return on assets (ROA). Firms exposed to higher geopolitical risks exhibit weaker profitability. However, firms with stronger ESG performance demonstrate greater resilience, as the GMM results show that ESG engagement moderates the adverse effects of GPR on profitability. This suggests that ESG initiatives enhance adaptive capacity in volatile geopolitical environments. In terms of policy implications, ESG should be promoted as a key strategy for firms operating in politically unstable regions. Governments and regulatory bodies may consider mandatory ESG disclosures and incentivizing sustainability practices to help firms mitigate external risks, improve financial resilience, and attract stable investment. Aligning corporate strategies with global ESG standards is essential to ensuring business sustainability amid ongoing geopolitical threats.",280107336,12,51,,

Therefore, in this study, the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of 281 prefecture-level cities was calculated by using the DEA–Malmquist method, and the policy effects were evaluated by setting up quasi-natural experiments. The results show that the carbon emissions trading system has a positive contribution to GTFP; when facing a more compatible carbon trading system, enterprises will choose two paths: innovation compensation and industrial upgrading to improve GTFP, so as to get rid of the cost constraints caused by carbon emission control; the policy effect of the carbon emissions trading system varies significantly in different regions. In the economically developed eastern region, the effect of policy implementation is relatively significant, while the effect of policy implementation in the western region is not significant. Further analysis shows that as a market-based environmental policy, the incentive effect of the carbon trading system relies on a perfect market system.

This study highlights that sustainable practices are transparent with financial objectives using the religious framework of Islamic finance. This research is based on Worldwide Vision 2030, which covers sustainable development and promotes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, as well as corporate governance factors, such as board composition and Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs). We use a hybrid approach for our findings, with a dataset spanning 2011–2023 for the quantitative analysis and 20 semi-structured analyses conducted for a qualitative approach that aligns with objectives. We found that environmental disclosure boosts profits and stakeholder trust. Corporate governance structures, such as environmental boards and sustainability committees, improve the environmental disclosure of financial performance in Islamic banks. In this positive interaction, specialized governance drives Sharia-compliant sustainability initiatives. SSBs help Islamic banks integrate sustainability and meet religious and ESG environmental standards. Board diversity and dedication in the sustainability committee both play important roles in enhancing environmental disclosure practices; in return, these improved financial performances. The interaction of environmental disclosure and board environmental expertise has a positive impact on the overall performance, which indicates that governance structure supports sustainability-related decision-making, aligning with transparency. This study suggests that Islamic banks standardize ESG frameworks, improve board environmental expertise, and invest in real-time sustainability reporting digital solutions.

Using 10 years of panel data across resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service sectors, the analysis employs the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for robust estimation. The results reveal a positive overall effect of ESG practices on ROA, with significant differences across industries. The study uses the categorization of resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service industries to examine the differential effects of ESG factors on ROA. However, environmental scores do not significantly impact ROA, suggesting uniform effects across industries. Social scores enhance ROA without notable industry‐specific differences, while governance scores show varying effects, indicating sector‐specific drivers of profitability. The analysis also highlights the moderating effects of industry categories on the ESG–ROA relationship, suggesting that the impact of ESG practices varies across different sectors. The study also considers the economic effects of COVID‐19, highlighting its marginal impact on ROA and the need for resilient financial strategies.

The ESG scores, its pillars and other financial metrics are taken from Refinitiv Eikon. The sample consists of 257 listed companies operating in BRICS countries throughout 2017–2021. The main method of the research is the Fixed Effect method for panel data. The results showed that there is no statistical significance between ESG and ROA. Besides, government pillars negatively affect ROA through CSR that is explained by legitimacy theory. As for TSR, ESG, social and environment pillars have positive effects on market performance measure, following stakeholder theory. Regarding economic performance, ESG and social pillar have negative influence on EVA spread.",268110479,10,39,,

However, they also pose significant challenges to long-term sustainability. While the existing literature provides valuable insights into their influence, a broader scope is necessary to reflect their role in advancing sustainable finance. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of 2,446 publications from the Web of Science (1996–2024) to map the evolving nexus between emerging technologies and finance. Our findings reveal an expanding research landscape, with key themes including the application of emerging technologies in solving financial problems, the integration of technologies with behavioural and regulatory frameworks, financial innovation for promoting development, risk management and financial stability, digital currencies and blockchain, digital transformation challenges, and sustainable finance. The analysis highlights the dual nature of emerging technologies: while they enhance financial efficiency, transparency, and inclusion, and offer significant opportunities to advance sustainable finance, they also introduce risks such as cybersecurity threats, algorithmic bias, regulatory challenges, and critical barriers to long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, we propose a research agenda prioritizing ethical governance, stress-testing AI models under economic crises, securing decentralized systems, mitigating greenwashing risks, and fostering globally aligned regulatory standards. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to tackle ethical, security, and inclusivity concerns. It is imperative for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions to align technological innovation with sustainability objectives to ensure that advancements contribute to the development of an equitable, resilient, and inclusive financial ecosystem.",286816896,10,484,,

Yet, established technology adoption theories offer limited tools for characterizing business AI integration and analyzing its effects. These primarily focus on the factors facilitating or hindering adoption, rather than on adoption patterns and impacts. This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to address this key gap and applies it to the case of the ESG rating industry. ESG raters play a pivotal role in sustainable finance, providing metrics that guide investment decisions globally. However, little is known about the extent and nature of their AI usage and its implications. Through a mixed‐methods approach combining the analysis of job postings, patent filings, research publications, and corporate websites, we examine AI adoption among major ESG raters. Our investigation explores the specific AI technologies employed, their functional applications, the innovations developed, the intensity of AI integration, and the potential impacts of raters' AI adoption. Our results reveal widespread and growing AI adoption across the industry. Our findings show that raters extensively leverage Natural Language Processing to streamline data collection, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, they have pioneered Machine Learning innovations that significantly expand their sustainability assessment capabilities in various domains. These findings mark a considerable departure from prior academic and gray literature that characterized major ESG raters as having minimal AI use, prompting critical questions regarding the implications of this technological transformation for ESG ratings' reliability, transparency, and potential biases.",281277870,10,131,,

By examining three experimental cases varying the level of environmental disclosure, we evaluate the investment judgments of professional (Study 1) and private German investors (Study 2). Primarily, we investigate whether traditional, commonly disclosed environmental information affects investor judgments. Furthermore, we explore the effects of linking non-financial reporting elements to quantitative financial measures through the EU taxonomy by adding taxonomy indicators. Specifically, we operationalized the case where companies fall into a category of poor environmental performance by taxonomy classification. We find that only traditional environmental disclosure in combination with standardized taxonomy-aligned information (below average), influences the investment judgment. However, professional investors exhibit a significantly negative response, while private investors show a significantly positive reaction when constraining reporting flexibility through the inclusion of standardized taxonomy measures with poor performance. Consequently, we conclude that the connection between non-financial reporting elements and quantitative standardized financial measures enhances transparency for professional investors. Private investors, on the other hand, reward additional taxonomy-aligned environmental information irrespective of its content. This implies that environmental information generally conveys positive signals to private investors, but uncertainty in investment judgment can be assumed.",272411741,8,81,,

The present study estimates the factors that help drive the global green bond markets, such as energy prices, gold prices, and green energy stocks. The study has applied Quantile Autoregressive Lagged Approach (QARDL) and Quantile Granger Causality test to estimate the causal relationship among the variables for January 2010 and June 2021. The QARDL findings reveal that for all the quantiles, the error correction term is statistically significant with the predicted negative sign. This confirms the existence of a strong long-run equilibrium relationship between the relevant variables and the green bonds market on a global level. The findings revealed that gold and energy prices have a lower effect on the green bonds market on every quantile, and also from the low to medium quantiles, respectively. While at the same time, the green energy stocks have an increasing effect on the green bonds market at higher quantiles. The results of the causal examination using Granger-causality in quantiles show a bi-directional causal relationship between the green bonds, energy prices, gold prices, and green energy stocks in the world economy.",22071513,36,91,,

It therefore uses the dataset pertaining to China from most recent time-series – covering the period spanning from the years of 1990 to 2020, by employing the Morlet Wavelet Analysis technique. The empirical findings of the wavelet power spectrum reveal that green finance GF and ER are vulnerable in the short- and long-run, and the short-run, respectively. At the same time, no vulnerability has been observed in the GDP, PR, and CO2 emissions. In addition to this, the wavelet coherence also reveals the bidirectional causal association that exists between GF-CO2 and ER-CO2, but only in the short run. It must also be taken into consideration that the causal influence of CO2 is deemed to be greater than the GF and ER, respectively. Besides this, a bidirectional causal nexus also exists between the GDP and CO2 emissions, only in the long run. Furthermore, the association between the economic growths follows both the phase and antiphase associations. Moreover, the study also reveals that there is no significant causal link between the PR and CO2 emissions. The results emphasize that the significance of green finance investment will tend to increase with strict policy implications, stabilization or minimization of economic risk and political risk.

This paper empirically examines the impact of corporate application of AI technology on corporate ESG performance using a sample of 4858 listed companies in China from 2007 to 2022. The study finds that: (1) corporate application of AI technology can significantly enhance corporate ESG performance, and this conclusion still holds after a series of endogeneity treatments and robustness tests; (2) mechanism analysis shows that the degree of corporate digitalization has a positive moderating effect in the process of AI technology affecting corporate ESG performance. The channel analysis shows that the application of AI technology can enhance environmental (E) performance by strengthening corporate green technology innovation, social (S) performance by improving corporate philanthropic responsibility, and overall ESG performance with the above two sub-items as the main aspects. However, AI technology also weakens the effectiveness of corporate internal control, which leads to a decline in corporate governance (G) performance; (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that AI technology promotes ESG more significantly in more competitive industries and tech-nology-intensive firms, and more significantly in the eastern and central regions than in the western and northeastern regions, and that large- and medium-sized firms are similarly superior to small-sized firms, while medium-sized firms have more room for upward mobility than large-sized firms, which embody a higher promotion effect than large enterprises.

Drawing on multiple theoretical frameworks, our empirical models employ firm fixed‐effects estimators to analyze an unbalanced panel dataset comprising 2226 firm‐year observations spanning 14 years. Our findings are three‐fold. First, our primary evidence reveals that both ESG disclosure and FinTech adoption have a statistically significant positive relationship with carbon performance. Second, we provide robust evidence that FinTech enhances the effectiveness of ESG disclosure by improving transparency, reducing information asymmetry, and facilitating access to green financial resources. Third, we find that carbon tax policies moderate these relationships, with firms in high‐regulation environments experiencing stronger positive effects. Overall, our results suggest that FinTech acts as an enabler, amplifying the impact of ESG practices on corporate carbon performance. Our findings are robust to various control mechanisms, alternative measures, and potential endogeneities. These results have implications for policymakers and corporate decision‐makers seeking to integrate FinTech into ESG frameworks, as well as for advancing country‐specific and regional approaches to climate change mitigation.",290412204,4,53,,

Evidence from different estimation techniques,"Kutay Gozgor, Mesut Karakaş",Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja,2023,"Abstract The green bond market has significantly improved in recent years thanks to the development of financial instruments and the rising climate change concerns. Given this backdrop, this paper investigates the effects of returns in different financial markets, i.e. the United States Treasury Bonds, the Standard & Poor’s stock market, the United States Dollar, Gold, Crude Oil, and Bitcoin on the Green Bond returns (the Standard & Poor’s Green Bond Index) from September 17, 2014, to September 1, 2022. The results from the robust linear and machine learning estimators indicate that the returns of the United States Treasury Bonds and the United States Dollar are negatively related to the Green Bond returns. Meanwhile, Gold returns positively affect Green Bond returns. The quantile regression estimations of Machado–Santos Silva also show that these findings are valid in different quantiles.

Due to high regulatory measures, this topic is becoming one of the most sustainable themes among emerging areas. There is ample literature on ESG as a sustainable business goal (SBG), but only a few studies have identified the factors that encourage the adoption of ESG reporting. The research aims to identify, determine and analyse the enablers of adopting ESG reporting adoption in developing economy India. Design/methodology/approach This study explores the strategic enablers that facilitate adopting ESG reporting practices in India. A thorough literature review and expert interviews were organized to accomplish the study’s goals. Initially identifying 23 enablers through expert interviews, this paper left with nine key enablers. Through an empirical analysis using m-TISM and MICMAC analysis, the current study has formulated the hierarchical structure to determine the relationship between strategic, operational and performance variables. Findings The research findings highlighted that the variables at the bottom of the model – a regulatory framework for a standardized code of reporting (E1), corporate governance reforms (E2) and regulatory efforts (E3) – are strategic determinants designed for successful ESG reporting adoption. Research limitations/implications To capitalize on these facilitators, the government must impose mandatory disclosure and advance the policies, rules and advantages of ESG reporting adoption. Encouraging wider adoption involves aiding SMEs in implementing ESG practices and providing incentives like tax relief, incentives or subsidies for outstanding ESG performance. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research in the field to use TISM and MICMAC-based hierarchical models to identify and analyse the relationship between strategic ESG enablers for adopting ESG reporting.",285346060,4,153,,

Prospect theory assumes that decision-makers react quickly when decisions are framed as a risk or threat rather than as an opportunity.Design/methodology/approachWe used a sample of 168 FIs across 27 countries and seven regions over the period 2003–2020. To conduct our empirical investigation, we compared the prediction accuracy of various machine learning algorithms.FindingsOur findings suggest that out of 12 machine learning algorithms, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost have the most precision in predicting whether FIs react to climate change risk in adopting ESG practices. This study also tested the overall climate change risk and risks associated with physical, opportunity and regulatory shocks of climate change. We observed that risks associated with physical and regulatory shocks significantly impact the adoption of ESG practices, supporting prospect theory predictions.Practical implicationsThe insights of this study provide important implications for policymakers. Specifically, policymakers must take into account the risk posed by climate change in the corporate decision-making process, as it directly influences a firm’s adoption of corporate actions (ESG practices).Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the firm-level climate change risk and adoption of ESG practices from a prospect theory perspective using novel machine learning algorithms.",274110846,4,95,,

Drawing on panel data from 2011–2012 to 2023–2024 for 86 publicly listed non-financial firms, the study employed a modified Ohlson valuation framework, panel regression analysis, and multiple robustness techniques (2SLS, PSM). ESG disclosure was measured using a researcher-developed index aligned with international reporting standards (GRI, SASB, TCFD, UN SDGs). ESG disclosures are positively associated with firm value, but this relationship is significantly moderated by corporate maturity. Younger firms exhibit a stronger valuation effect from ESG transparency, driven by higher signaling and legitimacy needs. In contrast, mature firms experience a diminished marginal benefit, reflecting routine compliance rather than strategic differentiation. These findings challenge the uniform application of ESG assessment models and suggest the need for lifecycle-adjusted disclosure ratings, particularly in nascent regulatory environments like Bangladesh. Investors and regulators should tailor ESG evaluation criteria by firm age and industry sustainability exposure. Younger firms, often overlooked, may carry outsized ESG signaling value in emerging markets. Enhancing ESG transparency among younger firms can foster greater stakeholder trust, support inclusive growth, and strengthen social accountability in emerging economies. This study contributes to the ESG literature by introducing corporate maturity as a key moderating variable in value relevance analysis. It provides new empirical insights from a developing economy and proposes lifecycle-based adaptations to global ESG rating methodologies.",288445390,3,36,,

Drawing on the Antecedents-Behaviour-Consequences (ABC) model, we investigate the mediating roles of GAI-powered exploitative and exploratory learning, and consider international entrepreneurship orientation and GAI education as key moderators. Using survey data from 402 manufacturing start-ups in China and employing PLS-SEM analysis, we find that GAI adoption significantly enhances both exploitative learning (β = 0.439, p < 0.001) and exploratory learning (β = 0.444, p < 0.001), which in turn drive SBMI (β = 0.254 and β = 0.353, respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, fsQCA reveals four distinct configurations of these factors that lead to high SBMI performance, highlighting the complexity of GAI implementation.

This research not only seeks to corroborate the AIDUA model in the banking sector, but also aims to enrich it by introducing technological literacy as a moderating factor, particularly in the perspective of sustainable banking. Data were collected through 435 valid, self-administered face-to-face surveys from bank customers in China, determined through convenience sampling. The hypotheses, covering both direct and moderating effects, were examined using structural equation modeling. This study verifies the applicability and reliability of the AIDUA model, in assessing customer acceptance of AIDs within sustainable banking services. The findings indicate that customer acceptance of AIDs unfolds in three distinct phases. Initially, the consumers’ perceptions of social influence (SI), hedonic motivation (HM), and perceived anthropomorphism (PA) positively influence their green performance expectancy (GPE) and green effort expectancy (GEE) concerning AIDs. As a result, greater GPE and GEE among bank customers lead to stronger positive emotions, which greatly contribute to increased AIDs usage and a reduction in resistance to their implementation. Additionally, the findings determine that technological literacy plays a substantial moderating role in the association connecting green performance expectancy and customer emotions in relation to adopting AIDs, thereby highlighting its importance in advancing sustainable banking initiatives.",280094739,14,82,,

Therefore, it is the centered area of research for the plethora of researchers across the globe. Instead of this significant transition to green finance, the study analyzed the Chinese data to explore the relationship between Green Finance, Green Technology innovation, and Environmental Performance from 2003 to 2022 in the Chinese context. We preferred the CS-ARDL and panel Quantile regression models for exploring our hypothesis and to examine the relationship of these variables. Our results validated that both green finance and green technology innovation have positive effects in both the long-term and short-term on the environmental performance in numerous Chinese cities. The statistical results showed that Green Finance and Green technology innovation reduce the amount of CO 2 emission. Hence our results confirmed that both Green Finance and green technology innovations are significantly contributing to the environmental quality of China as the selected cities considered for the study investigation are considerably more driven towards green initiatives. This research also discussed the potential for implementing policy interventions in the future to leverage the adoption of green technology and make a significant impact on the world’s environmental quality as China is the biggest emitter of CO 2 emissions. The study places and puts forward valuable insights to the regulatory bodies that would likely help them in achieving sustainable milestones and would contribute to their long-term strategic landscape for the attainment of environmental objectives and heights.",275417424,8,70,,

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines survey data capturing young investors' attitudes and financial portfolio analyses from a European institution to explore behavioral patterns and preferences in sustainable finance. The findings reveal a significant discrepancy: while environmental awareness and knowledge of sustainable finance are high, these factors do not necessarily translate into sustainable investment preferences. Key barriers include risk aversion, perceived high costs, and limited availability of attractive ESG investment options. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs and policy interventions to bridge the gap between ideals and actions. Limitations include a small sample size and reliance on self-reported data, which future research should address.

Yet, conventional literature often neglects to critically examine their economic, environmental, and social implications. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand when, how, and for whom artificial intelligence and big data in sustainable entrepreneurship generate value. Our findings suggest that the three dimensions of sustainability—economic, environmental, and social—should be examined through a tri‐level impact prism: the immediate efficiency or transparency gains firms report; the hidden or temporally deferred costs that accumulate; and—notably—the distributional consequences that determine who reaps the benefits and who inherits the burdens. Direct benefits can evolve into costs over time and, if neglected, may reinforce injustices that rebound and erode future gains. Whether the broader trajectory settles on the virtuous or vicious side of that loop depends on five boundary conditions: organizational capabilities, technological maturity, socio‐cultural values, sectoral and regulatory context, and temporal dynamics. Our study advances theory by extending the triple‐bottom‐line lens into a reflexive impact‐by‐cost framework—one that foregrounds rebound effects and justice considerations, injects power, path dependency, and distributional conflict into socio‐technical transition debates, and recasts contingency and dynamic capabilities theories around shifting cost and justice configurations.",288346791,7,134,,

Based on the export data of 100 developing countries on the product level from 1999 to 2015, this paper empirically explores the relationship between FDI and product export survival of the host country using the survival analysis model. The estimations show that FDI is conducive to the extension of the export duration of domestic products, and this effect is more evident in products with comparative advantages. Mechanism inspections prove that FDIs extend the export duration of products by improving their quality. To overcome endogenous problems, this paper establishes instrumental variables of FDI based on population and geographical factors. The results of the two-stage least square regression support the conclusions derived from the benchmark regression.

This paper takes the first round of Central Environmental Protection Inspection as a natural experiment, reflecting the degree of green transformation through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) level of enterprises. Taking Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2022 as the research object, a dual machine learning model is used to determine whether this system can improve the ESG level of enterprises and promote their green transformation. Using a dual machine learning model, it is found that the system can enhance the ESG level of enterprises and promote their green transformation. Mechanism analyses show that the system promotes green transformation by enhancing green innovation capability, safeguarding the rights and interests of upstream and downstream supply chain actors, and enhancing governance diligence, thus encouraging enterprises to assume environmental, social, and governance responsibilities. It is also found that at the macro-policy level, with the migration of the inspection area to the west and the strengthening of local environmental governance, and at the micro-firm level, the higher the degree of digitization and the larger the size of assets, the deeper the system effect on the green transformation of heavy-polluting enterprises.

A survey of 485 consumers served as the empirical foundation, with data analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM). Results show that minimalism and LOHAS both significantly enhance consumers' sustainable behaviors by strengthening attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control—key components of TPB. Furthermore, collectivist cultural values heighten the impact of minimalism and LOHAS on certain TPB constructs, indicating that communal support and shared environmental goals can amplify pro‐sustainability mindsets and actions. These findings underscore the importance of lifestyle‐driven approaches to sustainability, suggesting that firms and policymakers tailor marketing and policy initiatives to cultural contexts and highlight both the health and ecological benefits of minimalist, LOHAS‐aligned choices.

The main research findings of this paper are as follows: (1) The Sci-Tech Finance pilot policy significantly enhances corporate ESG performance, a finding that remains consistent after conducting parallel trends testing, propensity score matching, and placebo tests. (2) The policy promotes the corporate ESG performance through three intermediary channels, namely alleviating financial constraints, improving total factor productivity, and enhancing green technology innovation. Notably, the first two intermediary channels exhibit the most prominent effects. (3) The impact of the pilot policy on the corporate ESG performance exhibits heterogeneity at both the regional and corporate levels; it demonstrates a more pronounced impact on corporates located in the Eastern Region, within high digital economic zones, and among high-tech, capital-intensive, heavily polluting, and state-owned corporates.

This conceptual article addresses the theoretical and strategic gap in aligning resilience and sustainability by proposing an Integrated Sustainable Operational Strategy (ISOS) framework. Drawing on systems theory, circular economy principles, and sustainability science, the framework synthesizes multiple operational domains—circularity, localization, digital adaptation, and workforce flexibility—across macro (policy), meso (organizational), and micro (process) levels. This study constructs a conceptual model that explains the interdependencies and trade-offs among strategic operational responses in the Anthropocene era. Supported by multi-level logic and a synthesis of domain constructs, the model provides a foundation for empirical investigation and strategic planning. Key propositions for future research are developed, focusing on causal relationships and boundary conditions. The novelty of ISOS lies in its simultaneous integration of three strategic pillars—circularity, localization, and digital resilience—within a unified, multi-scalar architecture that bridges fragmented operational theories. The article advances theory by redefining operational excellence through regenerative logic and adaptive capacity, responding directly to SDG 9 (industry innovation), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (climate action).

Based on 273 cases and using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), this paper tests eight direct and moderating hypotheses. The results reveal that both gender diversity and board size positively impact firm value, while board size successfully reduces firm risk. However, gender diversity does not mitigate risks. The findings indicate that increasing board gender diversity and size are positively related to performance, while only board size contributes effectively to risk reduction. ESG disclosures play a moderating role, enhancing the synergy between gender diversity and performance but showing mixed effects on risk reduction.

Despite expectations that non-financial transparency enhances valuation, empirical findings in emerging markets remain inconsistent, warranting further investigation.ObjectivesThis study examines the effects of environmental, social, and governance disclosure and capital structure on firm value among firms listed in the IDX ESG Leaders index from 2020 to 2023. It also explores whether profitability moderates these relationships by strengthening or weakening their impact on valuation.MethodThe research adopts a quantitative approach using panel data regression with 68 firm-year observations from 17 IDX ESG Leaders firms. ESG disclosure indices were constructed through content analysis of annual and sustainability reports, while financial data were obtained from audited statements. Profitability, proxied by return on assets, was incorporated as a moderating variable through moderated regression analysis to identify conditional effects.ResultsThe findings reveal that environmental and social disclosure do not directly influence firm value, while governance disclosure exerts a significant negative effect. Capital structure shows a strong positive impact, and profitability both directly enhances firm value and moderates certain relationships. Specifically, profitability weakens the effect of social disclosure but strengthens the influence of capital structure, suggesting that investors prioritize financial fundamentals over non-financial reporting.ImplicationsThe results highlight the conditional relevance of ESG disclosure in emerging markets and reinforce the continuing importance of profitability and capital structure. Theoretically, the study challenges the universality of stakeholder and signaling theories by revealing context-dependent effects. Practically, it provides guidance for managers to align disclosure with financial strength and for policymakers to strengthen ESG reporting standards.Originality/NoveltyThis study contributes to the literature by disaggregating ESG disclosure into environmental, social, and governance dimensions and incorporating profitability as a moderating variable. It provides new evidence from Indonesia’s capital market, offering insights into how non-financial transparency interacts with financial strategies to shape firm value.",290793813,1,80,,

However, the literature at the intersection of data‐driven and sustainable BMI remains conceptually dispersed, limiting theoretical progress and practical application. To consolidate the literature, we combine a systematic literature review with bibliometric coupling to conceptualize data‐driven sustainable BMI. First, we identify five distinct research streams—digital platforms, circular economy, smart manufacturing and supply chains, blockchain, and servitization—which reflect diverse technological pathways to transform traditional business models into sustainable ones. Second, we develop a dynamic capabilities‐based process model that explains how companies can achieve this transformation by orchestrating data‐driven and sustainable capabilities across the initiation, ideation, integration, and implementation phases of BMI. This study advances theoretical understanding and provides practical guidance on how data‐driven technologies can enable positive environmental, social, and economic outcomes.",290940641,1,236,,

Grounded in social exchange theory and extending stakeholder exchange orchestration mechanisms, the research proposes that ESG initiatives foster reciprocal stakeholder relationships that drive innovation and performance through specific temporal and cultural exchange processes. Using survey data from 453 Chinese green manufacturing enterprises, we applied structural equation modeling to test the theoretical framework. Findings show that all perceived ESG dimensions, environmental, social, and governance significantly enhance both green technology innovation and competitive performance. Green technology innovation serves as a key mediator, illustrating how sustainability initiatives create competitive advantages through innovation mechanisms. Digital transformation amplifies these effects across all perceived ESG dimensions. This research contributes to sustainability literature by introducing stakeholder exchange orchestration theory, validating perception-based ESG measurements in emerging market contexts, and demonstrating digitally enhanced social exchange mechanisms. For practitioners, the study provides resource-constrained implementation strategies and innovation-focused approaches essential to maximize sustainable competitive performance outcomes.

Using data on Chinese A‐share listed companies from 2009 to 2020, we explore the relationship between geographic concentration of institutional investors and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Our findings indicate that investors' geographic concentration has an inverted U‐shaped influence on ESG performance, and high‐speed railway and institutional environment weaken the negative influence of geographic concentration of institutional shareholders, leading to a flatter inverted U‐shaped relationship. As high‐speed railway and institutional environment further flatten the curve, the inverted U‐shaped relationship will eventually become U‐shaped, and a “shape‐flip” occurs. Our research offers a new perspective on the factors impacting corporate ESG performance, enriching institutional investor characteristics, and having practical significance for improving ESG performance.",275157928,1,84,,

This conceptual review synthesizes existing literature to examine the interplay between governance mechanisms and financing choices. Drawing upon theories such as agency theory, trade-off theory, and stakeholder theory, this paper explores how governance structures—board composition, ownership concentration, and regulatory frameworks—shape capital structure decisions. Strong governance mechanisms enhance financial discipline, optimize debt-equity balance, and mitigate agency conflicts, whereas weak governance leads to suboptimal financing choices and financial distress. The review also highlights emerging trends, including ESG considerations, digital transformation, and AI-driven governance, which are reshaping traditional governance-financing paradigms. The study identifies key gaps in the literature and suggests future research directions, particularly in governance innovations, AI-based financial decision-making, and regulatory influences on capital structure strategies.

As an important part of the ecological system, rural areas also face many challenges. Rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality, as a solution, have attracted widespread attention. However, achieving the coordinated development of rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality requires more in-depth research and effective methods.This study aims to explore how to promote the coordinated development of rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality through the combination of a Transformer-RNN model and cross-attention mechanism. We propose a deep learning framework that combines the parallelism and global dependency capturing capabilities of the Transformer model with the temporal information handling capabilities of the RNN model. By integrating these two models, we leverage their respective strengths to improve the performance of the model. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism that enables the model to simultaneously focus on the relationship between rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality. Through cross-attention, the model accurately captures the impact of rural ecological construction measures on carbon neutrality and the feedback effect of carbon neutrality on the rural ecological environment. In our experiments, we collected relevant data on rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality, including environmental indicators, socio-economic factors, land use patterns, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.We preprocess the data and train the combined Transformer-RNN model with the cross-attention mechanism. The trained model demonstrates promising results in capturing the complex dependencies and relationships between rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality. The significance of this study lies in deepening the understanding of the coordinated development relationship between rural ecological construction and carbon neutrality and providing a novel deep learning-based method to solve related problems. By introducing the Transformer-RNN model with a cross-attention mechanism, we provide decision-makers with more scientific and accurate decision support, promoting the improvement of the rural ecological environment and the achievement of carbon neutrality goals.",268810063,1,41,,

This study aims to analyze whether sustainability governance influences sustainability performance and the extent to which sustainability performance affects a company’s cost of debt. This study analyzed 209 publicly listed companies in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Sustainability governance was measured using two proxies from the Refinitiv Eikon database: (1) the existence of a sustainability committee and (2) the existence of sustainability assurance. Sustainability performance and the cost of debt were assessed using scores obtained from the same database. Quantitative analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and structural equation modeling (SEM) with path analysis. The results showed that sustainability governance has a strong positive impact on sustainability performance. However, the results also show that higher sustainability performance leads to a higher cost of debt. This finding suggests that companies that integrate sustainability into their core business strategies face challenges in obtaining funding to support sustainability initiatives.

For instance, the European Union (EU) recently issued the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in December 2022 and implemented it starting in 2024 in member states. Non-financial disclosure is relevant for various stakeholders and could affect firm value. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of ESG disclosure on firm value in the EU context. Design/methodology/approach This study uses panel data on listed EU firms extracted from the Bloomberg database from 2014 to 2024. The final sample comprises 11,003 firm-year observations. The ordinary least squares method is used as a baseline regression. This study addresses the endogeneity issues by applying instrumental variable and two-step system dynamic panel generalised method of moments approaches. Findings The results of the univariate tests, including the mean-difference comparison test based on pre-CSRD and CSRD issuance periods, reveal a significant decrease in the average ESG disclosure score in the CSRD issuance period. These results are similar for individual ESG pillars. Further, the results show a significant reduction in average firm value in the CSRD issuance period. The regression results report a significant and positive effect of ESG disclosure on firm value. Practical implications This study provides practical implications for policymakers, firms and stakeholders. Based on the findings and the contexts of signalling and institutional theories, regulatory requirements for non-financial reporting on environmental and social issues affect a firm’s sustainable behaviour. This directly impacts various stakeholders, including market participants, and eventually affects market value. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on the relationship between ESG disclosure and firm value in the context of the transition from the non-financial reporting directive to CSRD.",287976999,6,122,,

Using a quasi-natural experiment of the staggered construction of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) demonstration cities in China, this paper explores the impact of fiscal policy on green credit (GC) for listed enterprises. The main findings are the following: (1) The ECER demonstration cities policy significantly improves enterprise GC. This conclusion remains robust after considering the heterogeneous treatment effects. (2) By extending the estimation period beyond the policy withdrawal, we use the difference-in-differences designs with multiple groups and periods (DIDM) estimator to compute the average treatment effect of policy switches. The results show that the intervention effect still exists after the policy withdrawal. (3) Direct cash subsidies, corporate green spending, and external financing constraints are the main mechanisms through which the ECER demonstration cities policy works. (4) The effects of the ECER demonstration cities policy are heterogeneous at the batch, urban, industry, and corporate levels. This paper explores the role of fiscal policy on enterprise green financing. The findings provide theoretical and empirical insights for leveraging fiscal tools to enhance environmental governance.

Living wages, typically set higher than minimum wages, pay enough for workers to meet their needs and those of their families. Without living wages many workers earn poverty wages. Recognising renewed corporate and investor interest in living wages, this paper interrogates the logics and rationalities which shape discussions on living wages, drawing upon 31 semi‐structured interviews with living wage professionals. Discourse analysis is used to identify the logics and rationalities which shape organisation‐level progress towards living wages. Some logics, surrounding human rights, stakeholder capitalism, sustainable development, redistribution and social justice, encourage the implementation of living wages. Other logics, including shareholder capitalism, profit and mass consumerism, create a chilling effect on the living wages movement. At present, wages are the main mechanism for distributing money, so wage levels impact people's access to services and resources. The living wages agenda is progressing rapidly, comprising a 2024 International Labour Organization meeting of experts, corporate and investor commitments, worker demands, and the growing prevalence of geographically specific living wages calculations. It is therefore crucial that the logics and narratives underpinning decisions on pay are interrogated as these play a pivotal role in progress towards human rights, social justice and the Sustainable Development Goals.",284017984,5,60,,

However, ESG data remain fragmented, inconsistent, and prone to methodological opacity—particularly in climate-related investments. This systematic review analyzes 43 peer-reviewed articles and 23 institutional reports to examine whether machine-learning-based ESG scoring models outperform rule-based systems in predicting sustainable investment performance. Following the PRISMA protocol, we applied thematic coding, regional benchmarking, and methodological evaluation across AI–ESG applications. A comparative framework was used to assess AI’s role in ESG integration, predictive analytics, impact measurement, and risk management, with a focus on the climate domain. We also propose and refine the ESG–AI Maturity Index, evaluating AI adoption capacity across data quality, model transparency, and portfolio integration. Findings reveal that AI-enhanced models—particularly those using ensemble learning and sentiment analysis—demonstrate superior performance in forecasting ESG outcomes. However, challenges such as algorithmic bias, regional data gaps, and lack of interpretability remain persistent. The ESG–AI Maturity Index provides a preliminary diagnostic tool for evaluating institutional readiness to adopt AI in ESG scoring.

10.1002/bsd2.70055,Impact of <scp>ESG</scp> Disclosures on Corporate Financial Performance: An Industry-Specific Analysis of Indian Firms,"Paridhi, Ritika",Business Strategy & Development,2025,"ABSTRACT This study investigates the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and return on assets (ROA) in Indian companies, focusing on industry‐specific variations. Using 10 years of panel data across resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service sectors, the analysis employs the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for robust estimation. The results reveal a positive overall effect of ESG practices on ROA, with significant differences across industries. The study uses the categorization of resource‐intensive, consumer‐facing, and service industries to examine the differential effects of ESG factors on ROA. However, environmental scores do not significantly impact ROA, suggesting uniform effects across industries. Social scores enhance ROA without notable industry‐specific differences, while governance scores show varying effects, indicating sector‐specific drivers of profitability. The analysis also highlights the moderating effects of industry categories on the ESG–ROA relationship, suggesting that the impact of ESG practices varies across different sectors. The study also considers the economic effects of COVID‐19, highlighting its marginal impact on ROA and the need for resilient financial strategies. However, the moderating effect of COVID‐19 on this relationship was not significant, indicating limited variation in the ESG–ROA dynamics during the pandemic period except in the governance model. These findings suggest that tailored ESG strategies, aligned with industry‐specific challenges, can optimize financial performance. Policymakers and investors are encouraged to focus on sector‐specific ESG practices to better evaluate company performance and formulate effective regulations. This research contributes to the emerging market context by emphasizing the importance of industry‐specific ESG integration for enhancing financial outcomes.",283794597,5,96,,

Therefore, the current study explores the role of the novel COVID-19 pandemic, the energy prices, and the subsequent financial uncertainty on the US market's environment and social responsibility index (ESRI), which is considered a good representation of the global market. The study has applied Quantile Autoregressive Lagged Approach (QARDL) for estimation using data from January 2010 to July 2021. The findings of the aforementioned relationships have been reported to be similar to the outcomes that have been observed for the short run, as reported in the longer period of time. Precisely, for energy prices and ESRI, the nature of the relationship remains negative. Moreover, in terms of the relationship between the financial uncertainty and ESRI, the nature of the relationship remains negative, while for the relationship observed between COVID and ESRI, the nature of the relationship remains positive. Based on these findings, maintaining the level of compliance towards ESRI, following the relevant SOPs, and improving the productivity of energy resources are viable measures that can be recommended.",16484724,5,89,,

Prospect theory assumes that decision-makers react quickly when decisions are framed as a risk or threat rather than as an opportunity.Design/methodology/approachWe used a sample of 168 FIs across 27 countries and seven regions over the period 2003–2020. To conduct our empirical investigation, we compared the prediction accuracy of various machine learning algorithms.FindingsOur findings suggest that out of 12 machine learning algorithms, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost have the most precision in predicting whether FIs react to climate change risk in adopting ESG practices. This study also tested the overall climate change risk and risks associated with physical, opportunity and regulatory shocks of climate change. We observed that risks associated with physical and regulatory shocks significantly impact the adoption of ESG practices, supporting prospect theory predictions.Practical implicationsThe insights of this study provide important implications for policymakers. Specifically, policymakers must take into account the risk posed by climate change in the corporate decision-making process, as it directly influences a firm’s adoption of corporate actions (ESG practices).Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the firm-level climate change risk and adoption of ESG practices from a prospect theory perspective using novel machine learning algorithms.",274791154,4,77,,

These subcategories include resource use, emission reduction and innovation under the environmental pillar, workforce, human rights, community and product responsibility under the social pillar and management, shareholders and CSR strategy under the governance pillar. Design/methodology/approach A machine learning technique known as “topic modeling” is used to analyse the current literature on ESG. To investigate the correlation between ESG scores and their subcategories with the investment decisions made by FII and to address concerns regarding multicollinearity and overfitting, a penalty-based regression model is employed. Findings The findings indicate that FIIs invest in firms with higher emission reduction and innovation scores under the environmental indicator. Additionally, firms with high human rights, community and product responsibility scores under the social indicator category have a positive relationship with FII investors. All subcategories of governance indicators, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), strategy, shareholders and management scores, also positively impact FII investment. Of the three indicators, i.e. ESG, non-promoter FIIs give maximum weightage to governance indicators. Research limitations/implications Since ESG is a contemporary topic, the findings on the relationship between different categories of ESG on FII investment will support managers in their FII investment. Also, the study will help the government frame policy decisions on ESG. Originality/value Previous studies have explored the impact of the overall ESG indicators on FII investments, but they have not specifically studied the influence of sub-indicators within these categories on investment decisions.

Tian, Yongqiang Zhu, Oleksii Lyulyov, Tetyana Pimonenko",Business Strategy and the Environment,2025,"ABSTRACT In the context of escalating environmental challenges and the imperative for sustainable economic transformation, corporate governance has emerged as a pivotal determinant of green technological innovation (GTI). This study empirically examines the nexus between the governance structure (GS) and GTI within China's manufacturing sector, leveraging an extensive dataset spanning 2011–2021. Through fixed‐effects estimation and intermediary effect modelling, the analysis reveals that a well‐structured GS significantly enhances firms' capacity for technological advancement in sustainability‐oriented innovation. Specifically, the regression results indicate that a one‐unit increase in corporate governance quality (CorpGov) is associated with a 0.249 increase in GTI (Lnpatent) at the 1% confidence level, affirming the substantial role of governance reforms in driving sustainable innovation. A key contribution of this study lies in unveiling the mediating role of internal control, which channels the governance–innovation link by fostering strategic discipline, mitigating risk aversion, and optimizing resource allocation. The results show that internal control quality (CI) increases by 12.183 for each unit improvement in CorpGov ( p &lt; 0.01), and subsequently, CI positively affects GTI, reinforcing its critical function in the innovation mechanism. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that governance reforms exert a disproportionately stronger influence on private enterprises (β = 0.312, p &lt; 0.01) than on state‐owned enterprises (insignificant effect) and firms in China's western regions (β = 0.411, p &lt; 0.01) compared with those in the eastern (β = 0.229) and central (β = 0.274) regions. These findings underscore the role of institutional and regional disparities in shaping the effectiveness of governance‐driven innovation. By integrating governance mechanisms, internal control efficacy and innovation strategy into a unified empirical framework, this research advances the theoretical discourse on corporate sustainability governance. The findings underscore the necessity for governance‐driven policy interventions aimed at fostering innovation‐led environmental sustainability, particularly in economies navigating the transition from regulatory compliance to market‐driven green investment.",291233850,1,81,,

Using Sign bias test and GARCH family models, the study finds that ESG equity indices have a leverage effect, significantly impacted by bad news over good news shock. The study has used FIGARCH model to measure the persistence of long‐memory effects across the emerging market. Further, to ensure the interconnection between ESG equity indices that may arise due to the persistence of long‐memory effects, the stusy has examined estimates of TVP‐VAR, and finds moderate interconnection between ESG equity indices. To be specific, ESG equity indices of the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea, Singapore, and India are more sensitive to receiving any sustainable innovation shocks from Brazil, South Africa, and Mexican ESG indices. The study finds significant bidirectional relationships between the ESG equity indices of “Philippines and Brazil,” “Indonesia and India,” and “South Africa and Mexico” that may lead to the spreading of market contagion in the presence of more substantial leverage effects with a long memory. This research offers insights for investors to consider sustainable equity assets for efficient portfolio diversification, mitigating environmental, social, and governance risks associated with volatility spillovers and dynamic connectedness. Policymakers may refer the findings of the study to design effective ESG regulations, for reducing risk in global financial system. Since the pandemic has produced more economic and financial instability in emerging markets, investors and regulators may pay more attention to return and volatility connectivity among ESG equity indices and financial markets to safeguard investment and restore market stability.",283280841,2,61,,

To address these concerns, the United Kingdom has strictly adhered to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), enhancing financial transparency and reducing the risk of manipulation. This study applies agency theory to examine the effects of earnings management and IFRS adoption on corporate sustainability performance, while also assessing the moderating roles of institutional ownership and board independence. Data were drawn from 248 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange between 2002 and 2024, using purposive sampling and sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon DataStream. Advanced estimation techniques, specifically the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and fixed effects models with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, were employed to address cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity. The results indicate that earnings management, as measured by discretionary accruals, has a significant negative impact on sustainability performance. In contrast, the adoption of IFRS has a positive and significant influence on sustainability outcomes. Additionally, institutional ownership and board independence significantly moderate the adverse effects of earnings management, leading to improved sustainability performance. The findings suggest that managers should enhance the clarity and accountability of financial reporting by implementing robust internal systems aligned with IFRS, conducting regular compliance audits, and training finance staff on current disclosure standards.",290657386,2,129,,

Using data from the 2021 National Financial Capability Study, multinomial regression analysis was used to explore whether people who rely on social media for investment decisions were more likely to invest in ways that reflect their values. The results show that investors who use social media for investment information are more likely to value being socially responsible as an important reason for investing. Younger, less experienced, and more risk-tolerant investors were especially likely to follow SRI strategies, and certain platforms like Twitter were more associated with SRI interest than others. These findings suggest that social media is not just a platform for sharing information; it may also shape how people think about investing and the role their money can play in making a societal difference.

It reveals the normalized importance values for the significant predictors—confirmation bias, endowment effect, hindsight bias, bandwagon effect, and ESG. By examining the biases from a behavioral finance perspective, a significant academic contribution is made in the context of retail investors, along with ESG as critical determinants influencing investment decisions. The study results enable investment firms to predict the extent to which their investment avenue programs impact investment decisions before developing these programs with appropriate ESG measures, thus enabling a sustainable investment ecosystem. The research contributes uniquely to the existing behavioral finance area by developing a framework to understand ESG dynamics and biases that collectively impact investment decisions.",289348721,2,138,,

Thus, we attempted to link corporate ESG to sustainable development. It was also investigated whether ESG contributes to a reduction in corporate risk. Using panel data and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique, we examine the relationship between ESG scores and important financial risk indicators such as systematic risk (beta), stock price volatility, unsystematic risk, and the cost of capital (WACC). The findings show that corporations place a disproportionate emphasis on governance (G) rather than environmental (E) and social (S) characteristics. ESG and G governance were also found to be statistically significant predictors of financial risk. This disparity shows that companies may be using high governance scores to conceal underperformance in environmental and social issues, raising worries about greenwashing and superficial compliance. As a result, their contributions to SDGs such as affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10) are minimal.

10.1002/bsd2.70172,Environmental Social and Governance Materiality Assessment: A Research Agenda,"Muhammad Sani Khamisu, Ratna Achuta Paluri",Business Strategy & Development,2025,"ABSTRACT Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements are increasingly gaining attention worldwide, prompting regulators in many countries to set mandatory ESG disclosure policies. However, there are major assertions that these policies will likely bring about unintended consequences, as some organizations may disclose deceptive information (greenwashing) while others might even ignore material ESG issues to comply with the policies. These issues raise concerns regarding organizational commitments to conducting proper materiality assessments. Subsequently, such concerns represent an emerging research stream in ESG policy development and literature. This article seeks to further the discussions by scientifically mapping the body of knowledge on ESG materiality assessment. Specifically, the review integrates co‐citation, keyword co‐occurrence, and thematic analyses to describe the past and present state of ESG materiality literature. Consequently, four major clusters of articles that researchers and policymakers rely on for ESG materiality philosophical background were identified, i.e., (1) The need for materiality assessment in corporate sustainability, (2) Materiality assessment disclosures for stakeholders, (3) Stakeholder activism for corporate legitimacy, and (4) Integrated reporting frameworks and institutional mechanisms. In contrast, the analysis uncovers five major clusters explaining the present state of ESG materiality assessment. The study further presents insightful research gaps with future research and policy implications. Therefore, the review contributes to contextualizing ESG materiality assessment by stressing the need to deeply understand the underlying constructs explaining the double materiality principle in the mandatory ESG disclosure policy.",289269981,1,107,,

This study therefore examines the effect of ESG disclosures on tax avoidance practices on the Jordanian business environment using a panel data set which comprises 2,595 firm year observations of non-financial firms listed at the ASE between 2003 and 2022. The results of multiple regression analysis show a significant negative association between governance disclosures and tax avoidance, indicating that high-quality governance system leads to maximize the firms’ accounting practices and choices that are lead to pay more taxes which in turn leads to enhance services provided to the community they operate in. However, environmental and social disclosures are found to be insignificantly associated with tax avoidance practices. This study recommends that the Jordanian regulatory bodies must devote more efforts and adopt restricted regulations in order to restrict the probability of adopting tax avoidance techniques in order to provide more financial resources to build up the infrastructure and provide more efficient services to the community.",268541266,2,23,,

Green Sukuk have emerged as innovative vehicles for mobilising capital towards renewable energy, climate adaptation, and sustainable infrastructure, yet they currently lack formal recognition within the ESF. Drawing on doctrinal legal analysis, comparative case studies of Malaysia and Indonesia, and policy evaluation, this study argues that formal ESF recognition would elevate Green Sukuk from voluntary ethical instruments to enforceable tools within the global sustainable finance framework. The analysis identifies key challenges of legal enforceability, regulatory fragmentation, and governance inconsistencies, and proposes a six-pillar strategy encompassing ESF-compatible issuance guidelines, harmonised regulatory approaches, dual Shariah–ESF compliance statements, enhanced impact measurement through digital tools, targeted incentives and capacity building, and multilateral support with risk-sharing mechanisms. Comparative lessons from Malaysia’s corporate-led model and Indonesia’s sovereign issuances demonstrate transferable pathways for aligning Green Sukuk with ESF safeguards. By integrating Islamic finance principles with international sustainability standards, the paper proposes a dual-assurance model that enhances transparency, mitigates greenwashing risks, and expands financial inclusion in Muslim-majority markets. The findings contribute to both Islamic finance and sustainable development scholarship by offering the first systematic framework for embedding Green Sukuk into the ESF, thereby extending their role in advancing the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.",294709404,1,11,,

It generally focuses on identifying the relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP), although the CSP-CFP link is not investigated enough in the context of changes in dividend payments. Purpose of the article: The paper aims to identify the relationship between CSP and changes in dividend payouts. To do this, a research hypothesis was formulated, stating that improving CSP in environmental, social, governance, and economic dimensions increases the propensity to pay stable dividends. Methods: The main empirical research method is the panel logistic regression model, which includes variables of corporate sustainability. Additionally, descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation coefficients are analyzed. The empirical research was conducted using data on the top global companies listed in the Global 500 of 2021 from the period of 2011–2021. All required data were retrieved from the Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters) Eikon database. Findings &amp; Value added: The main conclusion of the paper is that when all dimensions of corporate sustainability are integrated in the long run, only the strong effectiveness of corporate systems and processes inside a company make board members maintain dividends at the previous levels. It means that the research hypothesis cannot be confirmed for all corporate sustainability dimensions considered together. The value added of the paper is that the authors considered the long-term returns pillar score as one of the independent variables, which is not a commonly used approach, although economic sustainability is a key corporate sustainability dimension.",286338733,2,67,,

Firms currently grapple with fragmented ESG frameworks and overlapping disclosure mandates, which heighten reporting burdens and exacerbate information asymmetry. Through a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of 276 peer‐reviewed articles, this research uncovers significant redundancies in sustainability reporting and a pronounced imbalance between the established TCFD literature and the nascent TNFD scholarship. The study reveals that embedding biodiversity risks within climate disclosures enhances corporate resilience, transparency, and strategic adaptability. A critical theoretical synthesis drawing on legitimacy, stakeholder, institutional, agency, and signaling theories demonstrates that aligning TCFD and TNFD frameworks fosters coherent, credible, and cost‐effective reporting. This integration not only streamlines compliance but also strengthens investor confidence and governance quality.

It will also look into whether the type of company and its ownership structure affect how much information about the SDGs is included in financial reports. This study also tested whether SDG disclosures influence firm value. Analyzing companies listed on Indonesian stock exchanges will be the method of conducting this research. This study uses secondary data in the form of disclosure information from annual company reports. The data will be further analyzed using content analysis with a matrix referring to SDG reporting in annual reports. The data were described using descriptive statistics and analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Path analysis. This research showed that company size and company age positively influence SDG disclosure. The higher the ownership concentration in the company, the better the SDG disclosure, and the SDG disclosure positively influences firm value. This research showed that the level of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) disclosure among Indonesian companies is currently limited. This research also discovered that companies with greater complexity tend to provide more comprehensive information about their SDG efforts. It is important to focus on improving SDG disclosure among newer companies with lower ownership concentrations. Lastly, this research also indicates a connection between SDG reporting and company value, but the impact of this connection is relatively minor.",268359711,2,70,,

This study examines the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance on financing costs among Chinese non-financial listed firms, with a focus on the moderating roles of financial regulation and ESG rating divergence. Using a panel dataset of 4493 firms across 33,773 firm–year observations from 2011 to 2022, we employ a two-way fixed effects model, along with Propensity Score Matching and Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) techniques, to address endogeneity concerns and enhance causal inference. The findings reveal that improvements in ESG performance significantly reduce financing costs, substantially affecting debt relative to equity. Moreover, the cost-saving benefits of ESG are amplified in industries with stronger regulatory oversight, while high ESG rating divergence undermines these benefits by increasing uncertainty. These results highlight the importance of standardizing ESG rating systems and enhancing regulatory consistency. Such efforts can lower capital costs and improve financial access for firms, particularly in capital-intensive and environmentally sensitive sectors, offering actionable guidance for policymakers shaping disclosure frameworks and corporate managers optimizing ESG investment strategies.",288168736,2,63,,

The current study examines 3,846 firm-year observations of non-financial companies in a developing country namely China, which are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2016 to 2022. However, the wide range of research across various fields has led to a lack of clarity within the academic community regarding relationships between ESG performance, corporate commitment, competitiveness, and profitability in the context of China. Recent discussions on corporate commitment, competitiveness, and profitability metrics have brought greater attention to ESG performance, yet they have also contributed to growing misunderstandings of the concept. Additionally, vague definitions and constructs may hinder managers from effectively setting ESG performance objectives for their organizations. Utilizing data from credible sources, including Bloomberg, this research evaluates ESG performance through a comprehensive ESG score and examines its relationship with corporate profitability, and commitment. Hence, the study employs robust methods (i.e. OLS regressions) to assess ESG practice’s impact on corporate outcomes, considering various control variables like return on assets, firm age, financial leverage, ownership concentration, etc. The quantitative findings suggest that ESG performance positively correlates with enhanced corporate performance (β = 0.0.42, p &lt; 0.001), increased market competitiveness (β = 0.08, p-value = 0.001), and strengthened corporate commitment (β = −0.009, p-value = 0.002), thereby underscoring the importance of sustainable practices in achieving long-term business success.

This study explores how external forces and internal practices shape sustainable tourism management among technology-based SMEs in Bangladesh. Using the Stimulus–Organism–Response (SOR) framework, we examine how institutional requirements, market competition, and green human resource management influence the adoption of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and business analytics capability. These, in turn, affect sustainable tourism management performance. The analysis is based on 760 SMEs using structural equation modeling (SEM), propensity score matching (PSM), and fuzzy-set qualitative-comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results show that institutional pressure, market competition, and green human resource management all play an important role in encouraging SMEs to adopt ESG practices and develop business analytics capability. Both ESG adoption and analytics, in turn, make a strong contribution to sustainable tourism performance. The PSM analysis, which compares firms with high and low levels of ESG and analytics, confirms these findings: SMEs that adopt ESG practices achieve about 19% higher sustainability scores, while those with strong analytics capability perform about 17% better than others. The fsQCA results further reveal that there is no single path to achieving sustainability. Instead, different combinations of ESG practices, analytics capability, and competitive conditions can all lead to strong outcomes, highlighting the diverse strategies SMEs can follow. This research demonstrates the importance of ESG and data-driven decision-making for SME sustainability and offers practical guidance for entrepreneurs and policymakers working to strengthen tourism in emerging markets.",292121682,1,90,,

This paper investigates how ESG-related media coverage affects the cost of equity, with a focus on how improved information transparency can influence firms’ financing outcomes. Methods We construct an ESG performance index using a machine learning approach, based on ESG-related news text data and the level of media attention received by listed companies. The index is calculated by evaluating the tone (positive or negative) of each firm’s annual ESG news coverage. Results The results reveal a significant negative correlation between corporate ESG media coverage and the cost of equity, where more positive coverage is associated with a lower financing cost. Mechanism analysis confirms that stronger ESG performance can reduce equity costs by enhancing the transparency of corporate information. Heterogeneity analysis further shows that this negative relationship is more pronounced in state-owned and large firms.

These enterprises are implementing measures to trace and track raw materials and components, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards and ethical sourcing practices. This transparency is crucial in identifying and mitigating environmental and social risks within the supply chain. However, it is important to note that there is still a lack of extensive research in the context of China regarding sustainable practices in global supply chains. While some studies and initiatives have been conducted, there is a need for more comprehensive research to understand the specific challenges and opportunities faced by Chinese enterprises in adopting and implementing sustainable practices throughout their supply chains. The objective of this study is investigating the research progress on issue related Sustainable Practices in Global Supply Chains of Chinese Enterprises. In doing so, systematic literature research was implemented on the supply chains of Chinese enterprises' foreign direct investment (FDI) to provides insights into the penetration and significance of sustainable concepts in this topic. This paper utilizes advanced data visualization techniques and an in-depth literature review to comprehensively summarize and review previous research extracted from the Web of Science database.  The study included 518 articles and analyzed them through RStudio and VOSviewer software. Research analysis reveals that most of the past research articles on this topic primarily come from China, followed by large economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom. However, when ranked by influence, the order is Canada, the UK, and the US. Around 2020, collaborations between countries mainly occurred in Asian nations. China, enterprises, and FDI are currently the most popular keywords. The importance of sustainability in the research on FDI in Chinese enterprises has been verified through data analysis and theoretical review. Key terms related to sustainability, such as ""carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, and energy consumption"", are expected to play a vital role in future research. Current theoretical studies confirm that integrating environmental, social, and economic goals (ESG) into supply chain operations can implement a sustainable philosophy for the entire product lifecycle in Chinese OFDI enterprises.

This study applies the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development as a lens to review literature and investigate practices in Nordic banks on sustainability considerations in corporate credit risk assessment. Three gaps and recommendations are presented: (i) banks should apply a systems perspective that goes beyond a narrow focus on climate change to avoid sub‐optimisation; (ii) strategies like inclusion and exclusion should be informed by backcasting from basic sustainability principles to foresee the long‐term direction of change and to assess whether solutions are scalable towards sustainability; and (iii) instead of asking whether it ‘pays to be sustainable’, research and practice should focus on ‘how’ companies can work strategically with sustainability, finding the optimal timing between being too passive and too proactive.",286757003,1,90,,

Using Random Forest and structural equation modelling, four hypotheses examined the interconnected nature of fraud prevention and environmental disclosure practices. The research analyzed fraud risk management influence on environmental disclosures (H1), environmental disclosure impact on fraud risk management (H2), environmental stewardship effects on fraud risk management (H3), and fraud prevention impact on environmental protection (H4). Advanced machine learning techniques ensured robust statistical validation. The tested hypotheses' results provide empirical evidence supporting these hypotheses, with R 2 values ranging from 0.5149 to 0.7719. H1 achieved the highest explanatory power ( R 2 = 0.7719, 77.19% variance), followed by H2 ( R 2 ≈ 0.75) and H3 ( R 2 ≈ 0.73), while H4 showed moderate effects ( R 2 = 0.5149). Findings indicate that machine learning models demonstrated strong predictive relationships between fraud risk management and environmental outcomes. All hypotheses were supported, showing that fraud management significantly influences environmental disclosures and stewardship. Thus, organizations can leverage fraud controls to enhance environmental performance. In addition, utilizing data‐driven approaches enables targeted policy interventions and operational improvements in Nigeria's oil sector.

This study aims to investigate the interaction effect between offering supply chain finance (SCF) programmes and sustainability ratings on the liquidity performance of buyers and suppliers.

Design/methodology/approach
The study uses a unique sample of buyers that each have an SCF programme. The sample is complemented with financial information and sustainability scores. The data is analysed through a random effects model.

Findings
Aligning with recent advances in SCF literature, the results confirm a tendency for SCF programmes to favour buyers over suppliers. However, the relationship between SCF programme adoption and liquidity performance for buyers and suppliers is positively moderated by the strong sustainability performance of both parties.

Practical implications
Buyers and suppliers are advised to implement and adopt effective SCF programmes that are beneficial for both parties. For buyers, the authors suggest leveraging on SCF programmes as incentives to foster sustainable behaviour among suppliers. For suppliers, the authors recommend caution before joining programmes offered by buyers that do not perform well on sustainability.

Social implications
Enhancing sustainability within global supply chains and fostering favourable payment practices towards suppliers are crucial for policy development and regulation. The findings clarify the connection between both components, offering valuable insights for policymakers in this domain.

Originality/value
The study is built on a manually picked, unique database of buyers offering SCF programmes to their suppliers. This allows, across a large sample, an evaluation of the differences between buyers that offer SCF programmes and those that do not.

While academic interest in this intersection is growing, research remains fragmented and often lacks actionable insights into the organizational capabilities needed to operationalize sustainable AI innovation. This study addresses this gap by exploring how knowledge-based organizational capabilities—such as absorptive capacity, knowledge integration, organizational learning, and strategic leadership—support the alignment of AI initiatives with sustainability strategies. Grounded in the knowledge-based view of the firm, we conduct a bibliometric and thematic analysis of 216 peer-reviewed articles to identify emerging conceptual domains at the nexus of AI, innovation, and sustainability. The analysis reveals five dominant capability clusters: (1) data governance and decision intelligence; (2) policy-driven innovation and green transitions; (3) digital transformation through education and innovation; (4) collaborative adoption for sustainable outcomes; and (5) AI for smart cities and climate action. These clusters illuminate the multi-dimensional roles that knowledge management and organizational capabilities play in enabling responsible, impactful, and context-sensitive AI adoption.

The “Account Age” variable, standing for financial inclusion, is the share of adults owning accounts with formal financial institutions or with the providers of mobile money services, inclusive of both conventional and digital entry points. Methodologically, the article follows an econometric approach with panel data regressions, supplemented by Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) with instrumental variables in order to control endogeneity biases. ESG-specific instruments like climate resilience indicators and digital penetration measures are utilized for the purpose of robustness. As a companion approach, the paper follows machine learning techniques, applying a set of algorithms either for regression or for clustering for the purpose of detecting non-linearities and discerning ESG-inclusion typologies for the sample of countries. Results reflect that financial inclusion is, in the Environmental pillar, significantly associated with contemporary sustainability activity such as consumption of green energy, extent of protected area, and value added by agriculture, while reliance on traditional agriculture, measured by land use and value added by agriculture, decreases inclusion. For the Social pillar, expenditure on education, internet, sanitation, and gender equity are prominent inclusion facilitators, while engagement with the informal labor market exhibits a suppressing function. For the Governance pillar, anti-corruption activity and patent filing activity are inclusive, while diminishing regulatory quality, possibly by way of digital governance gaps, has a negative correlation. Policy implications are substantial: the research suggests that development dividends from a multi-dimensional approach can be had through enhancing financial inclusion. Policies that intersect financial access with upgrading the environment, social expenditure, and institutional reconstitution can simultaneously support sustainability targets.

This case study examines the spatial dimension of retail-driven land-use transformation by analyzing supermarket expansion in the Veneto region (northern Italy), with a focus on a large grocery retailer. We evaluated its corporate environmental claims by assessing land consumption patterns from 1983 to 2024 using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The GIS-based methodology involved geocoding 113 Points of Sale (POS—individual retail outlets), performing photo-interpretation of historical aerial imagery, and classifying land-cover types prior to construction. We applied spatial metrics such as total converted surface area, land-cover class frequency across eight categories (e.g., agricultural, herbaceous, arboreal), and the average linear distance between afforestation sites and POS developed on previously rural land. Our findings reveal that 65.97% of the total land converted for Points of Sale development occurred in rural areas, primarily agricultural and herbaceous lands. These landscapes play a critical role in supporting urban biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services, which are increasingly threatened by unchecked land conversion. While the corporate sustainability reports and marketing strategies emphasize afforestation efforts under their “We Love Nature” initiative, our spatial analysis uncovers no evidence of actual land-use conversion. Additionally, reforestation activities are located an average of 40.75 km from converted sites, undermining their role as effective compensatory measures. These findings raise concerns about selective disclosure and greenwashing, driving the need for more comprehensive and transparent corporate sustainability reporting. The study argues for stronger policy frameworks to incentivize urban regeneration over greenfield development and calls for the integration of land-use data into corporate sustainability disclosures.

10.3390/su17219791,Does ESG Uncertainty Disrupt Inventory Management? Evidence from an Emerging Market,S. Aldawsari,Sustainability,2025,"The growing prominence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations has introduced new challenges for firms worldwide. While ESG practices are often framed as long-term drivers of competitiveness, uncertainty surrounding their regulatory requirements has created significant operational risks. The primary objective of this study is to examine how ESG uncertainty (ESG) affects inventory management in listed firms. The study analyzed data from Chinese A-share listed companies over the period 2010 to 2024. A series of econometric estimations, including fixed effect models, two-stage least squares (2SLS), and system GMM, were employed to ensure the robustness of the results and to address issues of heteroscedasticity, endogeneity, and dynamic effects. The empirical results consistently revealed that ESG uncertainty exerted a significant negative effect on inventory management. Firms facing greater unpredictability in ESG-related requirements experienced disruptions in supply chain coordination, difficulties in demand forecasting, and inefficiencies in inventory turnover. Beyond this, larger firms and those with higher environmental expenditures exhibited weaker inventory efficiency, while debt ratio, cost of capital, and firm performance were positively associated with improved inventory outcomes. For corporate managers, the study highlighted the importance of embedding sustainability considerations into inventory strategies and adopting flexible procurement systems, predictive analytics, and stronger governance mechanisms. The findings underscored the broader societal need for clarity and stability in ESG regulations. For this, reducing policy unpredictability could enable firms to align sustainability commitments with operational efficiency, thereby improving competitiveness while minimizing waste and resource misallocation. This study was among the first to empirically establish the link between ESG uncertainty and inventory management, bridging the gap between sustainability research and operational efficiency.",292243141,1,34,,

Abbas, Muhammad Adeel, Ghulam Akbar, Sadaqat Hayyat, Samina Bibi, Ghulam Muhayyu Din",Deleted Journal,2025,"Rapid urbanization in developing countries has intensified the demand for affordable housing while exposing critical gaps in environmental sustainability. Balancing affordability with eco-friendly practices remains a major challenge, as many low-cost housing initiatives overlook sustainability due to cost constraints, leading to long-term inefficiencies and environmental degradation. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines sustainable design principles with digital technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), modular construction, and smart energy systems to support the development of affordable, eco-friendly urban housing. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research employs bibliometric analysis, systematic literature review (SLR), and policy document analysis to explore global trends, evaluate practice efficiency, and identify policy gaps. Key findings highlight three central themes: construction and energy cost-efficiency, financial accessibility, and sustainable architectural design. Innovative practices such as the use of renewable energy, green materials, and digital planning tools are shown to enhance housing sustainability and community resilience. However, significant gaps persist in policy integration, financial mechanisms, and scalability. The paper also examines the social impact of sustainable housing, emphasizing improvements in quality of life, social equity, and community engagement. Case studies from various countries illustrate how sustainable urban design can reduce environmental footprints while fostering inclusive, walkable neighborhoods. This research provides a practical framework for policymakers, architects, and urban planners to develop eco-conscious, affordable housing solutions that meet both environmental and social needs.",289877323,1,49,,

10.3390/su17177575,Does Corporate ESG Performance Influence Carbon Emissions?,"Ziyang Liu, Baogui Yang, Bernadette Andréosso-O’Callaghan, Xuepeng Zhang",Sustainability,2025,"Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global carbon emissions and China’s commitment to achieving carbon peaking by 2030, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy has become an urgent priority. As fundamental microeconomic entities, enterprises play a crucial role in the national governance of carbon emissions. This study uses panel data on Chinese A share listed companies from 2019 to 2023 and employs fixed effects models that control for firm, year, and industry effect to analyze how ESG performance influences carbon emissions and through which mechanism. The findings indicate that improvements in ESG ratings significantly reduce firms’ carbon emissions. This effect operates primarily through the following two channels: (1) promoting green technological innovation, thereby enhancing environmental performance, and (2) increasing the attention of financial analysts, which strengthens external monitoring. The heterogeneity analysis further reveals that the mitigating effect of ESG improvement on carbon emissions is more pronounced in firms with a lower proportion of institutional ownership, while this effect is relatively weaker in firms with higher institutional ownership. This suggests that in contexts where institutional investors hold a smaller share, firms may place greater emphasis on the policy pressure and social responsibility expectations associated with ESG performance, thereby exhibiting stronger commitment to emission reduction actions. In contrast, in firms dominated by institutional investors, the implementation of ESG policy objectives may be partially compromised due to the investors’ short-term profit orientation. This study provides empirical evidence for firms to fulfill their environmental and social responsibilities and offers actionable insights for investors aiming to promote sustainable development. From a policy perspective, the findings also offer theoretical support for developing differentiated regulatory strategies based on variations in ownership and shareholding structures.",289891655,1,71,,

Kumar",Studies in Economics and Finance,2025,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the impact of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) components on firm value (FV) in Nifty 50 firms. Furthermore, it explores how the Climate change risk, a key aspect of SDG 13 (Climate Action), moderates the relationship between ESG disclosures (ESGD) components and FV. Moreover, it examines the heterogeneity of results among high-low polluting industries; it aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and how firms with different pollution levels integrate sustainable production practices with economic motives. Design/methodology/approach The pooled OLS model with industry effect is applied to panel data of 50 Nifty Indian firms from 2017 to 2023. The climate vulnerability index is used as a moderating variable to investigate the moderating impact of climate change risk on the relationship between ESGD components and FV. Industries are classified into high and low-polluting industries as per norms of the Central Pollution Control Board of India. Furthermore, 2SLS, two step system GMM estimation and alternative measure robustness test are conducted. Findings The study explored the negative impact of Environment (ENV) and Governance (GOV) performance on the value of nifty 50 firms; climate vulnerability magnifies the negative impact of ENV and GOV performance. Higher ENV performance negatively impacts FV in both high and low-polluting industries, but the negative impact is stronger in low-polluting industries. Enhancing GOV and Social (SOC) performance negatively impacts FV only in low-polluting industries. SOC and GOV performance has an insignificant impact in high polluting industries. Moreover, the Climate vulnerability index magnifies the impact of ESGD components on the FV of Nifty 50 firms, high- and low-polluting samples. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to the Indian context and Nifty 50 firms. Furthermore, it can be extended to other emerging countries to have more comprehensive findings.

Wang",Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,2024,"Abstract Based on selecting A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2013 to 2022 as the research sample, this paper explores the effect and mechanism of ESG performance on corporate innovation efficiency using a regression analysis model. It is found that ESG performance is positively correlated with corporate innovation efficiency at a 1% significance level with a correlation coefficient of 0.057, which means that ESG performance can improve corporate innovation efficiency. Government subsidies play a mediating role in the relationship between corporate ESG performance and corporate innovation, and corporate ESG performance can enable enterprises to obtain more government subsidies, which can promote the enhancement of corporate innovation capacity. The results of heterogeneity analysis show that the ESG performance of non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises in the growth period has a more obvious effect on the improvement of corporate innovation efficiency, and their correlation coefficients reach 0.537 and 0.483, respectively. To summarize, based on the enterprise level, exploring the impact and mechanism of ESG performance on green innovation efficiency has important theoretical and practical significance for promoting the transformation of a low-carbon economy.",275201217,0,20,,

Using textual analysis of annual reports to measure compliance attention, we employ OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression, moderation, and mediation analyses. The findings reveal three key results: (1) Management compliance attention is positively associated with ESG performance (β = 0.041, p &lt; 0.01); (2) Board faultlines strength significantly amplifies this positive impact (β = 0.114, p &lt; 0.01); (3) Organizational resilience partially mediates the relationship between management compliance attention and ESG performance, as confirmed by a Sobel test (z = 3.089, p = 0.002). Heterogeneity analysis shows that state-owned enterprises exhibit more pronounced compliance-driven ESG improvements, whereas private firms rely on board diversity to enhance such effects. This study contributes to the literature by integrating institutional theory, cognitive theory, upper echelons theory, and dynamic capabilities theory, demonstrating that management compliance attention boosts ESG performance through organizational resilience, with board faultlines acting as a critical moderator. Practical implications include recommendations for firms to strengthen compliance cultures, foster diverse boards, and build organizational resilience, while policymakers should enhance compliance frameworks and ESG disclosure standards to promote sustainable corporate practices.",290441307,0,69,,

Considering the theoretical importance of corporate sustainability performance in the credit rating process, we aimed to develop a data mining model to predict the credit rating of companies, by incorporating ESG data to traditional accounting and financial measures with a sample of 6622 firms. For this purpose, four different classification and regression methods were utilized, i.e., regression analysis (RA), generalized linear model (GLM), CHAID tree analysis (CTA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The comparison of the fitting methods shows that CTA is the most appropriate method for modeling SmartRatios credit rating predictions, since it has the highest correlation coefficient (R) and the lowest relative error. Leverage (LEV) and profitability (ROA) emerged as the most important variables across all methods to predict the credit rating. The ESG pillars, environmental (E), social (S), governance (G), and ESG controversies (C) present a mixed landscape of importance values across the models. Our findings revealed that each component of ESG, environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G), contributes uniquely to predicting credit risk, which emphasizes the significant potential of integrating ESG data to the traditional financial performance indicators to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of credit rating predictions.",286232233,0,95,,

Analyzing 30 publicly listed companies reporting ESG metrics on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2021 to 2023, we employ path analysis and Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) to test moderation effects. The findings reveal a multidimensional ESG-financial performance relationship: (1) a positive impact on the Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER), indicating enhanced access to sustainable financing; (2) a dynamic relationship with Net Profit Margin (NPM), suggesting evolving ESG-related tradeoffs between costs and benefits; and (3) insignificant effects on Gross Profit Margin (GPM) and Return on Assets (ROA). The moderation analysis reveals that firms with high NPM are more effective at leveraging ESG benefits for debt expansion. At the same time, the interaction between ESG and GPM facilitates sustainable financing, even with high gross margins. These results underscore the importance of strategic ESG integration, particularly in light of time-lag effects and project selectivity.

 In line with the theme of this special issue: Rethinking the Creation of Social Value through Projects, this paper rethinks social value in projects by separating it from related terms such as social procurement and social reporting. The paper adopts an objectivist worldview, rendering social value a set of defined project requirements. From this perspective, this paper develops the social trifecta: a framework that connects social value, social procurement and social reporting as sequential and interdependent tools for creating measurable social outcomes. The aim is to give project teams a clear and accountable way to define, deliver and verify social value through projects.
 
 
 
 This paper employs a systematic literature review, analysing peer-reviewed journal articles, books and reports from reliable databases, and then scoring the most relevant and impactful sources to extract information from. The systematic literature review focused on the themes of social value, social procurement and social reporting. It identified recurring gaps and conceptual inconsistencies. From this systematic literature review, the paper theorised the social trifecta framework to tie up social value with these social constructs and how they can all be used together in a project context to effectively define and deliver social outcomes.
 
 
 
 The study reveals that social value, social procurement and social reporting are often treated as independent constructs and are insufficiently (and inconsistently) defined across the academic literature. This fragmentation limits their conceptual clarity and practicality in delivering measurable and meaningful social outcomes. By presenting them as interdependent and sequential elements that create social outcomes, and then tying them under one framework (i.e. the social trifecta), social value can be transformed from loosely defined and ambitious targets to clear and measurable social outcomes.
 
 
 
 To provide a concise conceptual framework, the paper takes an objectivist view of social value. It introduces the social trifecta as a conceptual framework that connects social value, social procurement and social reporting as distinct but sequentially interdependent constructs. This paper helps project practitioners make sense of social value as a set of project requirements, definitions and targets that are interdependently achieved.

Employing a robust quantitative methodology, the study critically analyzes the data of 2425 firms from HTAS. The CFP and ESG scores data were collected from the Refinitiv Eikon (REE) database for 21 emerging Asian economies from 2019 to 2024. The study considers the independent variable ESG scores and the dependent variables Current Ratio (CR) and Net Profit Margin (NPM). To explore the relationship, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, robust pooled ordinary least square regression (POLS), random effect model (REM), fixed effect model (FEM), and robust REM were explored in detail. The study revealed that the ESG score has a ‐ve correlation with CR (−0.088**) and NPM (−0.055*). The empirical models show that no significant relationship exists between ESG score and CFP (CR; NPM) of HTAS in emerging Asian economies. The comparative analysis of models highlights that the robust REM is an effective and reliable model. The work contributes to the stakeholder theory and shows the relationship between ESG score and CFP, specifically CR and NPM. The finding highlights that policy and decision‐makers in emerging Asian economies must pay significant attention to ESG and reassess ESG disclosure.

To address these limitations, this study introduces a hybrid ESG risk assessment model that integrates court ruling data with traditional ESG ratings to detect latent sustainability risks. Using a dataset of 213 ESG-related U.S. court rulings from January 2023 to May 2025, we apply natural language processing (TF-IDF, Legal-BERT) and explainable AI (SHAP) techniques to extract structured features from legal texts. We construct and compare classification models—including Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Legal-BERT-based hybrid model—to predict firms’ litigation risk. The hybrid model significantly outperforms the baseline ESG-only model in all key metrics: F1-score (0.81), precision (0.79), recall (0.84), and AUC-ROC (0.87). SHAP analysis reveals that legal features such as regulatory sanctions and governance violations are the most influential predictors. This study demonstrates the empirical value of integrating adjudicated legal evidence into ESG modeling and offers a transparent, verifiable framework to enhance ESG risk evaluation and reduce information asymmetry in sustainability assessments.",290611518,0,52,,

Using a sample of 7136 internationally listed firms from 2014 to 2022, we find that while the market imposes penalties on firms for material ESG controversies, it does not appear to do so for immaterial ones. Our study also finds that the regulatory quality in a firm's home country intensifies the adverse effects of material ESG controversies on firm performance. We present findings and interpret them within existing theoretical frameworks, particularly through the lenses of signaling theory and institutional theory. While prior literature has presented mixed findings regarding the impact of ESG controversies on firm performance, our study outlines potentially important drivers behind these conflicting outcomes and provides new insights to the nonmarket strategy field through our consideration of the nature of ESG controversies and key country‐level influences.",290659338,0,68,,

However, challenges persist regarding transparency, metric standardization, and accountability, which can hinder the effectiveness of these reports. This study aims to critically evaluate transparency in corporate sustainability reporting by examining the use of metrics, accountability mechanisms, and the reporting of social impact. Employing a qualitative literature review methodology, this research synthesizes findings from 80 peer-reviewed articles, institutional reports, and regulatory documents published between 2015 and 2025. Data were collected systematically from databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and official sustainability standard repositories such as GRI and SASB. Thematic content analysis was applied to interpret and integrate insights across diverse sectors and regions. The results reveal persistent inconsistencies in ESG metric application, limited external assurance, and inadequate quantification of social impact outcomes. Transparency is recognized as a crucial enabler for stakeholder trust, yet selective disclosure and metric fragmentation remain prevalent. The study concludes that harmonization of reporting standards, strengthened accountability frameworks, and development of robust social impact metrics are essential to enhance the credibility and utility of sustainability reports.

However, evidence regarding the impact of green accounting and leverage on firm value, particularly within Islamic capital markets, remains inconclusive. This study investigates how green accounting and leverage affect firm value, with financial performance acting as a mediating variable, among basic materials firms listed on the Indonesia Sharia Stock Index (ISSI).ObjectivesThis research aims to analyze the direct and indirect effects of green accounting and leverage on firm value through financial performance. It also seeks to determine whether sustainability-oriented accounting practices contribute to firm valuation and to evaluate the mediating role of profitability in shaping these relationships within an Islamic financial context.MethodA quantitative research design was employed using panel data from six basic materials firms listed on the ISSI during 2019–2023. Green accounting was measured using environmental cost disclosure, leverage by the debt-to-equity ratio, financial performance by return on assets, and firm value by Tobin’s Q. Data were analyzed using path analysis and the Random Effect Model, supported by classical assumption and Sobel tests to assess mediation effects.ResultsThe findings indicate that green accounting and leverage do not have significant direct effects on either financial performance or firm value. However, financial performance significantly mediates the relationship between green accounting and firm value, suggesting that sustainability initiatives enhance firm valuation indirectly through profitability. In contrast, financial performance does not mediate the relationship between leverage and firm value. These results demonstrate that environmental accountability contributes to firm value when translated into financial efficiency but not through debt-financed strategies.ImplicationsThis study highlights the need for firms to integrate environmental expenditures as strategic investments rather than operational costs. It underscores the importance of aligning sustainability initiatives with financial management and governance frameworks to optimize firm value. Policymakers should strengthen regulatory incentives for environmental reporting and enhance investor awareness to bridge the gap between sustainability performance and market valuation.Originality/NoveltyThis study contributes to sustainability accounting and Islamic finance literature by empirically establishing the mediating role of financial performance in the relationship between green accounting and firm value.

Khan, Mustafa Khan, Arsalan Mujahid Ghouri",Discover Sustainability,2025,"Abstract This study investigates the strategic importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices for enhancing firm financial performance (FFP) in developing economies, where sustainability efforts are often underprioritized. Amid the global push toward sustainability, emerging markets still lag in integrating ESG into corporate strategy due to weak enforcement, limited awareness, and short-term financial orientations. This study is therefore necessary to clarify whether and how ESG practices can yield financial benefits in such contexts, providing evidence-based insights for firms and policymakers seeking sustainable competitiveness. Motivated by the growing need to align corporate strategy with sustainability goals, this research examines how ESG practices influence financial outcomes directly, and indirectly through green innovation (GI). Grounded in the natural resource-based view (NRBV) theory, we address a specific gap by clarifying the mixed evidence on ESG’s financial effects in emerging markets and testing the mediating role of GI using firm-level data in emerging market context. We collected data using a structured questionnaire from respondents at non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the results demonstrate that all three ESG dimensions significantly and positively influence return on assets (ROA); however, the ESG dimensions have a significant negative effect on return on equity (ROE). Moreover, GI mediates the relationship between ESG and FFP. The findings highlight that ESG, often overlooked in emerging economies, can be strategically leveraged through GI to achieve better financial outcomes.

Santillán-Salgado",Risks,2026,"A longstanding debate in finance concerns the impact of social responsibility actions on firms’ long-term profitability. This study provides a broad analysis on the relationship between ESG, its components, and stock returns. Using a dataset that spans from December 2014 to December 2023, this research analyzes an annual average of around 2260 publicly traded companies from Europe and the United States. The findings consistently show a negative link between ESG ratings, their components, and stock returns, a result that is possibly explainable by the mixed effect of a reduction of risk (lower risk premium) from social responsibility, and lower profitability from associated costs. The coefficients for ESG and its pillars in explaining stock returns are generally consistent, with a few exceptions for the environmental and governance components. The environmental pillar has a stronger influence in Europe, across firm sizes, while in the US, the effect is limited to larger companies. For governance, variations align with differing ownership structures across regions and changing investor priorities as firms grow, with stronger influence in Midcaps of both regions and in U.S. Large Caps.

10.3390/su17219607,How ESG Rating Divergence Undermines Financial Flexibility and Sustainable Resilience,"Peng Zhu, Jiaqi Liu",Sustainability,2025,"Owing to the lack of a unified ESG (environmental, social and governance) rating standard, notable inconsistencies have appeared in ESG ratings assigned to the same firm by various rating agencies. Based on data encompassing Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2023, this paper investigates the effects of ESG rating divergence on corporate financial flexibility. We find that ESG rating divergence reduces corporate financial flexibility, and the finding remains reliable following various robustness tests. Mechanism tests show that ESG rating divergence diminishes corporate financial flexibility by raising operating leverage and the cost of equity capital, and exacerbating the degree of maturity mismatch between investing and financing. Further, we find that the negative impact of ESG rating divergence on financial flexibility is more pronounced in heavily polluting firms, enterprises with stronger market competitive positions, those facing lower financing constraints and companies with higher analyst earning forecast accuracies. We subsequently explore the economic effects of financial flexibility in reaction to ESG rating divergence. The findings indicate that ESG rating divergence negatively affects corporate sustainable resilience by first reducing financial flexibility. Overall, this study reveals the specific effects and pathways via which ESG rating divergence affects the financial flexibility of firms, holding significant implications for actively promoting the establishment of ESG systems and achieving sustainable corporate growth.",292235739,0,70,,

 This study aims to predict the risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) among social media users in Saudi Arabia using machine learning (ML) techniques. By analyzing Instagram posts, the research seeks to identify lifestyle and behavioral patterns indicative of T2DM risk.
 
 
 
 A multi-stage methodology was used, incorporating data collection, preprocessing, topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation, sentiment analysis via TextBlob and feature engineering through Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency vectorization. A Random Forest classifier was developed and optimized through hyperparameter tuning. The model was evaluated against other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors) using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC).
 
 
 
 The Random Forest classifier achieved 90% accuracy with an ROC-AUC of 0.92, outperforming other models. Linguistic features, sentiment polarity, and behavioral indicators, such as physical activity, food habits, and hashtag usage, significantly contributed to the predictive model. A five-topic model yielded the highest coherence score in topic modeling, demonstrating clarity in key health-related themes. The study underscores the potential of Instagram data in early T2DM risk detection.
 
 
 
 This research is one of the first to utilize Instagram data in the Saudi context to predict T2DM risk, offering culturally contextualized, behavior-based insights for early detection. It demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating sentiment analysis, topic modeling and ML for digital health surveillance. The findings contribute to the growing field of health informatics by showing how user-generated content can enhance early intervention strategies.

The review aims to make the discussion accessible while maintaining academic rigor. The results demonstrate that while ESG reporting in developed economies has been strengthened by regulatory frameworks such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, developing countries continue to rely on voluntary and inconsistent disclosure practices. Quantitative evidence indicates a positive association between robust ESG disclosure and corporate outcomes such as profitability, market valuation, and stakeholder trust, though these effects vary across sectors and national contexts. However, significant obstacles persist, including fragmented regulatory approaches, data quality limitations, and misleading practices that erode investor confidence. The discussion highlights the influence of systemic factors such as governance structures, cultural norms, and investor activism, and suggests potential solutions through standardization, independent assurance, and participatory oversight. Future research directions are proposed to address gaps in developing countries and evaluate new regulatory frameworks. These findings reinforce the urgency of advancing ESG disclosure as a credible and impactful mechanism for achieving sustainable corporate transformation.",292389742,0,28,,

 This paper aims to analyze the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) components on the board of directors’ remuneration and the moderating effect of gender diversity on this impact.
 
 
 
 To achieve this aim, we have used panel data methodology on 337 Iberian-listed companies from 2013 to 2022, employing the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM).
 
 
 
 Our results suggest that companies with high ESG practices tend to adopt conservative policies regarding board members’ remuneration, and the sole effect of board diversity also works toward conservative compensation. Furthermore, gender diversity mitigates the negative impacts of environmental and social performance on remuneration but strengthens the negative impact of governance performance in this relationship.
 
 
 
 This study provides a novel perspective on the relationship between ESG performance and board member remuneration by introducing gender diversity as a moderating factor, an area still underexplored in the existing body of literature. Additionally, it uniquely contextualizes this analysis within Iberian-listed companies, emphasizing the regulatory impact of gender quotas and their implications on sustainable governance practices. Finally, by analyzing all three ESG pillars and incorporating gender diversity as a moderating variable, the study introduces a fresh perspective on sustainability initiatives and diverse leadership. This comprehensive approach advances the discussion on executive compensation and the role of ESG in promoting equitable and sustainable corporate governance practices.

However, its impacts are upon environment too, which can be both positive and negative. Against this backdrop, the study explores empirically the pair-wise long-term equilibrium relationships and short-term dynamics between AI and labour productivity, AI and gross domestic product (GDP), and AI and CO2 emissions over the period from 2012 to 2023, focusing on a panel of the top 20 AI-investing countries. Initially, the analysis using correlation coefficients reveals that most countries show a positive relationship between AI and labour productivity, as well as AI and GDP. Conversely, there was a negative relationship between AI and CO2 emissions in these countries. For more robust conclusions, the study has employed panel data econometric methods. The Westerlund cointegration test results indicate that long-term stable relationships exist between AI, labour productivity, GDP, and CO2 emissions in the selected countries. Furthermore, the PMG-ARDL model reveals that AI does not have impacts upon labour productivity, GDP, and CO2 emissions in the short run. However, in the long run, AI significantly boosts labour productivity and GDP, while not contributing to CO2 emissions.

This research employs a sample of LQ45 listed companies in Indonesia from 2020 to 2023, generating 100 panel data units from 25 companies, which were analyzed using random-effects GLS regression. Documentation was used for data collection. The results indicate that ESG ratings do not provide significant evidence of influencing firm performance as measured by return on assets, return on equity, and earnings per share. The presence of a board of directors with several meetings can negatively affect firm performance. A notable finding of this study is the positive and significant impact of the female board of commissioners' composition on the firm's performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity. The proportion of female board members also significantly impacts ESG ratings. However, only company size can significantly affect EPS. This study suggests that a female board of commissioners has a positive impact on firm performance and ESG ratings. This study extends the upper echelon theory by proving that gender diversity on boards of commissioners plays a significant role in improving a company's financial performance and ESG rating. This study highlights the role of female commissioners on ESG and company performance, emphasizing the importance of gender diversity in boards of commissioners.",293115221,0,44,,
10.3390/e27111164,Information-Theoretic ESG Index Direction Forecasting: A Complexity-Aware Framework,"Kadriye Nurdanay Öztürk, Ö. Yiğit",Entropy,2025,"Sustainable finance exhibits non-linear dynamics, regime shifts, and distributional drift that challenge conventional forecasting, particularly in volatile emerging markets. Conventional models, which often overlook this structural complexity, can struggle to produce stable or reliable probabilistic forecasts. To address this challenge, this study introduces a complexity-aware forecasting framework that operationalizes information-theoretic meta features, Shannon entropy (SE), permutation entropy (PE) and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence to make Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) index forecasting more stable, probabilistically accurate, and operationally reliable. Applied in an emerging-market setting using Türkiye’s ESG index as a natural stress test, the framework was benchmarked against a macro-technical baseline with a calibrated XGBoost classifier under a strictly chronological, leakage-controlled nested cross-validation protocol and evaluated on a strictly held-out test set. In development, the framework achieved statistically significant improvements in both stability and calibration, reducing fold-level dispersion (by 40.4–66.6%) across all metrics and enhancing probability-level alignment with Brier score reduced by 0.0140 and the ECE by 0.0287. Furthermore, a meta-analytic McNemar’s test confirmed a significant reduction in misclassifications across the development folds. On the strictly held-out test set, the framework’s superiority was confirmed by a statistically significant reduction in classification errors (exact McNemar p < 0.001), alongside strong gains in imbalance-robust metrics such as BAcc (0.618, +12.8%) and the MCC (0.288, +38.5%), achieving an F1-score of 0.719. Overall, the findings of the complexity-aware framework indicate that explicitly representing the market’s informational state and transitions yields more stable, well-calibrated, and operationally reliable forecasts in regime-shifting financial environments, supporting enhanced robustness and practical deployability.",293146432,0,114,,

A single-case study was conducted on Rural Bank, PT BPR “C”, while primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews, and company documents. Risks were identified, analyzed, evaluated, and addressed in accordance with ISO 31000 principles, while ESG factors were embedded in the strategic mapping of BSC perspectives. The results reveal that environmental risks exert the most significant impact on financial outcomes, notably influencing key indicators such as Non-Performing Loan (NPL), Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), and Return on Assets (ROA). They highlight the urgent need for proactive risk mitigation strategies. By mapping risks to strategic objectives, the institution improves transparency, resilience, and alignment between risk management and performance measurement.

Using ESG Score data from the Refinitiv database, this study analyzes 232 firm-year observations from 2018 to 2023. SPCR is measured using Negative Skewness (NSKEWNESS), an indicator capturing the asymmetry of return distributions that reflects the buildup of hidden bad news and Down-to-Up Volatility (DUVOL), which captures downside volatility relative to upside movements. Regression results show that the aggregate ESG Score significantly reduces SPCR when measured with NSKEWNESS, indicating that firms with stronger ESG engagement are less likely to experience extreme negative price declines. When decomposed, the Environmental and Social components significantly mitigate SPCR, while Governance exhibits a negative but insignificant effect. However, none of the ESG components significantly influence DUVOL, suggesting that ESG practices may be more effective in addressing long-term crash risk rather than short-term price volatility.

Employing fixed effects, the generalised method of moments, and instrumental variable models, we find that stronger ESG performance is significantly associated with lower credit risk, as measured by the distance to default. Mediation analysis reveals that this relationship operates primarily through enhanced profitability and improved external governance. In contrast, Tobin's Q acts as a negative channel, potentially reflecting market overvaluation and inefficiencies. ESG's impact also varies across firm types: the risk‐reducing effect is most pronounced among non‐state‐owned enterprises (NSOEs), firms based in eastern provinces, and those in the growth or decline stage of the corporate lifecycle. Further analysis shows that environmental (E) and social (S) pillars drive credit improvements, whereas the governance (G) score has an insignificant effect. Our findings provide theoretical and empirical insights into the ESG–credit risk nexus, highlighting the importance of sector‐specific, regionally sensitive ESG strategies in emerging markets.",294462058,0,77,,

Drawing on the resource-based view, legitimacy theory, and agency theory, this study examines both direct and indirect mechanisms connecting corporate profitability, firm size, and ownership concentration to enhance ESG performance. This research employs secondary panel data from the CSMAR, DIB, and WIND databases (13,911 observations) and estimates two-way fixed effects models with firm-clustered standard errors. The outcomes show that profitability, firm size, and ESG performance have positive relationships, but ownership concentration is a negative factor in ESG performance. Market share and managers’ risk preferences mediate the relationship between firm characteristics and ESG performance; however, these effects are interpreted as exploratory due to panel data constraints. Internal control enhances these relationships, which emphasize the importance of the process of sustainability itself. The study provides practical insights that managers, policymakers, or investment firms can apply to improve ESG integration accountability in the emerging markets context.",294485370,0,110,,

In this context, the systematic risk component (CAPM's beta) emerges as a critical factor that needs to be deeply analyzed, taking into account ESG. Since the relationship between ESG and the systematic risk is largely controversial, this study aims to explore this latter by also considering the moderating role played by two types of internal controls: the audit committee independence and the ESG‐related executive compensation. To reach the target, an analysis on a sample of 200 non‐financial European listed companies observed from 2015 to 2023 has been performed with a fixed effects estimator and random forest. Findings reveal an inverted U‐shaped relationship between ESG score and beta as well as a moderating role played by the internal controls, providing several theoretical and practical contributions.",294634714,0,44,,

The Impact of Listed Companies' Generative AI Disclosure on ESG Rating Divergence: A Signaling Theory Perspective,"Kan Wu, Y Chen, Weicheng Xiao, Jerry C. Hu",(missing journal),2025,"<title>Abstract</title> Publicly listed companies are increasingly disclosing information related to generative artificial intelligence (GAI), yet it remains unclear how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies—as key information intermediaries—interpret these complex signals. This study extends signaling theory to examine the effect of corporate GAI disclosures on ESG rating divergence, highlighting that the impact depends on the interaction between signal complexity and signal credibility. Using textual analysis of annual reports from listed firms and combining these with ESG ratings from multiple mainstream agencies, we conduct an empirical investigation. The results show that: (1) low-complexity disclosures, such as merely mentioning GAI concepts or products, have no significant effect on rating divergence; (2) disclosures describing concrete applications and use cases of GAI effectively reduce information asymmetry and thus significantly converge rating divergence; (3) high-complexity disclosures, such as claims of possessing underlying technologies, without sufficient credibility support, increase interpretive difficulty and thereby amplify rating divergence in an inverted U-shaped pattern; and (4) firms' ownership of AI-related patents, serving as a key credibility signal, can substantially mitigate the negative effects of high-complexity disclosures. This study reveals the mechanisms through which emerging technology disclosures shape ESG rating divergence, offering a novel explanatory dimension for understanding its sources, and providing important practical implications for corporate disclosure strategies and market regulation.",294930228,0,64,,

Design/methodology/approach A three-stage process was used to analyze a dataset of 1,267 companies from knowledge-intensive industries. In the first stage, principal component analysis was applied to identify the types of ESG-related activities. Next, using cluster analysis, we identified patterns or modes of ESG-related behavior. Third, the identified clusters were compared in terms of their innovation-related behavior. Findings Compared to companies that demonstrated low ESG engagement, enterprises that have adopted comprehensive ESG strategies were found to be more likely to foster innovation and thus achieve sustainable competitive advantages. Our results highlight the particular importance of relational capital in stakeholder collaboration and knowledge sharing. Research limitations/implications While measuring ESG and innovation at the corporate level presents inherent challenges, this study contributes positively by offering a structured categorization of ESG modes, enabling more precise and meaningful comparisons. Our framework reduces ambiguity in assessing ESG-innovation dynamics and provides a solid foundation for future research. Moreover, the study opens exciting avenues for exploration, such as investigating the causal relationship between ESG engagement and innovation outcomes. Future research can build on these insights to examine how specific ESG models drive distinct innovation characteristics, particularly in developing economies and among SMEs, thereby enriching the global understanding of sustainable corporate strategies. Practical implications The study’s findings provide actionable insights for companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders on strategically integrating ESG and innovation. Businesses can leverage these insights to better align their ESG and innovation strategies, recognizing the critical role of relational and structural capital. Fragmented ESG communication yields limited value compared to cohesive strategies that foster external collaboration. Policymakers, in turn, should link innovation incentives to broader ESG strategies, ensuring a holistic integration that encompasses all ESG dimensions to enhance long-term competitiveness and sustainability. Social implications Adopting a broad ESG approach, rather than focusing on isolated aspects, is crucial for fostering sustainable innovation and generating societal benefits. Companies should assess ESG holistically, considering environmental, social and governance dimensions to maximize synergies with innovation. Stakeholder engagement and external cooperation are essential for developing effective and inclusive ESG initiatives. Furthermore, greater emphasis should be placed on the social dimension of ESG, which remains underdeveloped in many organizations. Future research could explore how small and medium-sized enterprises navigate this relationship and examine regional differences to better understand the social impact of ESG and innovation. Originality/value The results offer meaningful insights for corporate strategy, including the need for a holistic approach to intellectual capital management in ESG-driven innovation. In order to promote long-term sustainability and value creation, policymakers should encourage the alignment of innovation incentives with broader ESG frameworks.",294931066,0,91,,

Evidence from Indonesian Mining,"Meilenia Rahma Salisa, Yudisthira Jannata Muhammad Isa",Research Horizon,2025,"This study explores the influence of asset retirement obligations and firm size on environmental, social, and governance disclosure, with Sharia index inclusion as a moderating factor among mining companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2021 to 2024. The aim is to assess how environmental liabilities and organizational resources affect environmental, social, and governance disclosure and whether Sharia compliance modifies these relationships, contributing to ESG and Islamic finance literature. The research analyzes panel data from mining firms using moderated regression to evaluate the impact of asset retirement obligations, firm size, and Sharia index inclusion on environmental, social, and governance disclosure. Findings show that of asset retirement obligations and firm size positively influence ESG disclosure, driven by transparency needs and resource availability. However, Sharia index inclusion does not strengthen the asset retirement obligations environmental, social, and governance link, as firms view reclamation as a financial burden rather than a sustainability commitment. Conversely, it enhances the firm size-environmental, social, and governance relationship, reflecting higher stakeholder expectations for Sharia-compliant firms. The study highlights of asset retirement obligations and firm size as key drivers of ESG disclosure, with Sharia compliance amplifying the size effect but not environmental commitments. It offers practical insights for regulators, investors, and managers to foster sustainable governance in resource-intensive sectors.",294983172,0,43,,

The research is classified as descriptive, documentary, and quantitative, covering the period from 2019 to 2023. The initial sample of 26,017 companies was refined to 5,552 after excluding financial institutions and records with incomplete data. For the empirical analysis, quantile regression models were applied at τ = 0.05, τ = 0.50. and τ = 0.95, allowing the capture of heterogeneous effects of ESG performance. The results reveal that smaller companies face significant obstacles in implementing ESG practices, particularly due to financial and operational constraints. In contrast, larger companies demonstrate greater capacity to internalize the benefits of these practices, which is reflected in improved corporate performance. The study contributes to the ongoing debate by showing that the impact of ESG initiatives is not uniform, varying according to the pillar considered and the size of the organization. These findings reinforce the importance of public policies and business strategies that take into account the structural specificities of companies in order to promote corporate sustainability more equitably.",294989010,0,35,,

Drawing on data from China’s A-share listed firms from 2006 to 2022, this study empirically examines the impact of ESG environmental performance on corporate performance. The results reveal that ESG environmental performance significantly enhances corporate performance. This finding remains robust after addressing potential endogeneity by employing analyst attention as an instrumental variable and treating the implementation of the Environmental Protection Law as a quasi-natural experiment. The mechanism analysis indicates that green innovation serves as a crucial channel through which ESG environmental performance promotes corporate performance. Further, the moderating analysis shows that firms with stronger market competitiveness amplify the positive effect of ESG environmental performance on corporate performance. This amplification arises from the dual mechanism of strengthening the contribution of green innovation to firm performance while simultaneously weakening the driving effect of ESG environmental performance on green innovation. The heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the positive impact of ESG environmental performance on corporate performance is more pronounced among non-state-owned enterprises, firms with executives holding green backgrounds, companies without environmental penalties, and those operating in non-high-tech and non-high-pollution industries. Overall, this study provides theoretical support for corporate green transformation and offers valuable policy implications for optimizing sustainable development strategies.",295188130,0,9,,

The aim of this literature review is to identify, document, and analyze the key performance indicators (KPIs) applied in the sector, with emphasis on environmental, social, and economic dimensions, and to investigate the extent to which technical energy interventions are linked to business and consumer benefits. The methodology was inspired by the general logic of organized search and selection procedures, and for this reason, elements of the PRISMA framework were used, with a search conducted across multiple international scientific databases and selection criteria ensuring the validity and relevance of the sources. The analysis classified the indicators into the following three categories: environmental (e.g., CO2 emissions, energy consumption), social (e.g., customer satisfaction, corporate image), and economic (e.g., ESG score, return on investment). The study revealed substantial progress made by supermarket chains globally in adopting energy-efficiency technologies, such as LED lighting and renewable energy with proven benefits in reducing consumption and consequently, improving environmental performance. However, a lack of holistic integration between technical interventions and social-economic indicators was identified, limiting the use of KPIs as a strategic tool for guiding specific sustainability strategies. This research concludes that there is a need to develop unified, sector-specific measurement frameworks that integrate environmental, social, and economic parameters, as well as empirical research that quantitatively connects energy strategies with business and consumer performance through comparable indicators in the context of supermarket operations, thereby opening ground for further exploration of the field.",295319179,0,32,,

Additionally, this research explores how investors distinguish between disclosures that represent genuine commitment to sustainability and those that may be indicative of “greenwashing,” and how such distinctions impact their assessment of an issuer’s credibility as well as the issuer’s performance subsequent to the issuance of a “green” bond. The methodology employed in this research employs a convergent mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative methods (Natural Language Processing (“NLP”), financial modeling, etc.) with qualitative methodologies (case studies, interviews). The NLP methodology employed in this research includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and ambiguity measurement in order to determine the tone, thematic content, and linguistic clarity of the disclosure texts. Subsequently, the results of the NLP methodologies are correlated with firm level outcomes using cross validated partial least squares regression (“PLS-R”), event study methodologies, and one way ANOVA to test for temporal and industrial variability. Finally, the results of the computational and financial methodologies are supplemented by qualitative case studies and interviews to provide context for the patterns identified in the computational and financial methodologies. In summary, the results of this research demonstrate that firms that communicate in a clear, balanced, and verifiable manner experience better market reaction and more favorable accounting results subsequent to the issuance of a “green” bond than do firms whose communications are vague, overly optimistic, or lacking in consistency. Conversely, the findings suggest that investors have become increasingly sensitive to potential “greenwashing” and therefore are less likely to respond favorably to communications characterized by the aforementioned characteristics.",296214374,0,23,,

This study examines how FinTech development affects financial sustainability, using institutional preparedness as a moderating variable and digital transformation as a mediating factor. The study uses fixed-effects panel regression analysis to investigate cross-regional dynamics using a panel dataset of 18 rising economies in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia from 2015 to 2025. FinTech development considerably improves financial sustainability, according to empirical studies (β = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), with digital transformation processes mediating about 38% of this benefit. This association is further strengthened by institutional preparedness, suggesting that regulatory frameworks and governance quality are crucial for maintaining FinTech-driven growth. Southeast Asia has the strongest correlation between FinTech adoption and sustainability, according to regional studies, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa's influence is still limited by policy and infrastructure constraints. The results highlight how FinTech may promote equitable and sustainable financial systems when it is backed by strong digital governance.

Research Findings/Insights This study takes the sample of heavily polluting industry firms listed on Chinese A‐shares from 2011 to 2020 and finds that government environmental attention can effectively reduce the stock price crash risk. The mechanism analysis suggests that government environmental attention mitigates crash risk by reducing information asymmetry. The improvement of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms can enhance the dampening effect of government environmental attention on the crash risk. Theoretical/Academic Implications First, our study offers a new perspective for exploring the determinants of crash risk and enriches the literature on the role of government environmental attention in financial markets. Second, we make a significant contribution to the literature on the attention‐based view. We not only enrich the application of the attention‐based view, but also provide new theoretical grounding for how government influences corporate behavior through soft constraints such as environmental attention. Third, our study advances the theoretical understanding of corporate governance by integrating the attention‐based view and the perspectives of internal and external governance. It emphasizes the “amplifier” role of internal and external governance mechanisms in transmitting governmental environmental attention. Practitioner/Policy Implications This study reflects the forward‐looking guidance role of government work reports from an empirical perspective, which has practical significance for the government to improve its environmental policies, for firms to optimize resource allocation and prevent the crash risk, and for the capital market to maintain stable operation. It also integrates the internal and external governance environment of firms, which helps optimize the corporate governance system, improve the corporate governance mechanism, and provide theoretical guidance for corporate management.",297099198,0,116,,

At the same time that these technologies are becoming more integrated into routine operations, the focus has shifted to the ethical and environmental consequences associated with their widespread application. An investigation of the operational sustainability associated with the generative artificial intelligence systems would be crucial, as it would provide information about how these systems match ideals such as efficiency, circularity and environmental responsibility. We explore how users understand and engage with sustainability principles, specifically lean, circular and green operational frameworks within generative artificial intelligence environments. We collect user reviews of 72 recently launched generative AI platforms from 2022 to 2024 and utilise advanced machine learning methods, including Word2Vec modelling, sentiment and regression analysis, to reveal how text datasets reflect customer perceptions. We find that the lean theme is the most prominent feature of operational sustainability, with the highest sentiment score, followed by the green and circular themes.

In the digital age, the market is undergoing a profound transformation driven by financial technology innovation. Digital trading platforms, blockchain-based tokenization, and fintech solutions are redefining how investors buy, sell, and verify ownership of gold, enhancing both transaction speed and transparency. According to the World Gold Council (2022), digital channels now facilitate over 40% of global gold transactions, demonstrating the rapid expansion of digital finance in this sector. Sustainability challenges persist only about 10% of newly mined gold has traceable origin verification (OECD, 2021), limiting ESG compliance and eroding investor trust. Empirically examines how blockchain, fintech platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance ESG integration, transparency, and traceability across the gold investment ecosystem. Using a mixed empirical analytical approach with secondary data from the World Gold Council (WGC), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Scopus-indexed studies (2019–2024), the findings reveal that digital finance mechanisms increase ESG reporting accuracy by 38% and reduce transaction opacity by 27%.

Using panel data on U.S. firms from 1995 to 2019, we compare firms that invest in brand capital through advertising with firms that do not. The results reveal an interesting asymmetric pattern. Specifically, BCI firms experience greater sales gains following positive ESG occurrences but incur significantly larger losses following negative ESG events. Interestingly, non-BCI firms benefit less from positive ESG activities but face smaller penalties from negative ESG occurrences. This study contributes to the marketing literature by examining brand capital investment and how ESG activities translate into performance gains versus when they impose performance costs for firms.",297452735,0,94,,

Using ESG scores and corporate financial data from Bloomberg, three panel models were estimated: a random-effects model for ROA, a fixed-effects model for ROE, controlling for size, leverage, growth, and cash flow, and a test for sectoral differences between energy and non-energy companies. The results indicate that governance scores are positively associated with ROA (β = 0.011, p = 0.092), whereas ESG scores are weakly positively associated with ROA (β = 0.020, p = 0.080). Environmental and social scores are not statistically significant to ROA or ROE. For ROE, firm size is the main significant predictor (β = 2.126, p = 0.042). The results observe significant differences between the energy and non-energy sectors, with the energy sector reporting higher financial performance after controlling for ESG. Finally, this study indicates that ESG reporting policies that promote good governance can yield faster returns to shareholders.AcknowledgmentThis study was supported by the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Greater Education and Al-Madani School of Economic Sciences.&amp;amp;nbsp;",297456705,0,47,,

This study addresses this gap by investigating how ESG sensemaking capability mediates the relationship between GenAI integration and environmental performance, analyzing how sustainability information overload moderates the relationship between technological adoption and ESG sensemaking, and exploring the influence of regulatory uncertainty on the link between ESG sensemaking and environmental performance. Drawing upon organizational information processing theory (OIPT), the study develops and tests a conceptual framework using data collected from 610 firms. The results indicate that GenAI integration enhances environmental performance both directly and indirectly through improved ESG sensemaking. However, when sustainability‐related information becomes excessive, this positive effect weakens. In contrast, regulatory uncertainty amplifies the beneficial relationship between ESG sensemaking and environmental outcomes. These findings highlight that technology adoption alone does not guarantee sustainability gains; organizational interpretive capacity is important. This study extends OIPT by introducing ESG sensemaking capability as a distinct interpretive mechanism that bridges information‐processing fit and sustainability outcomes, distinguishing it from absorptive and dynamic capabilities. In addition to empirical evidence, we validate our findings through triangulation with real‐world use cases.",297491614,0,59,,

Using a sample of 110 listed banks across 18 developing countries from 2012–2013 to 2021–2022, this study employs regression analysis to assess the impact of GWS on FP. The study uses the peer‐relative GWS score by Yu et al. and introduces boardroom diversity and ESG controversies as moderating variables to analyze their influence on the GWS‐FP relationship. The findings reveal that GWS negatively affects the FP of banks in developing economies. Furthermore, the presence of female directors on bank boards moderates this relationship, reducing the financial penalties associated with GWS. ESG controversies, on the other hand, amplify the negative impact of GWS on FP, indicating the importance of a holistic approach to sustainability. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature by examining the nexus between GWS and FP, specifically within the banking sector of developing economies—a context that has received limited attention.

The results indicate that firms with lower ESG risk are more highly valued by the market, as reflected in higher EPS. However, ESG risk ratings do not have a significant effect on firm market value as measured by Tobin’s Q, suggesting that investor stock valuations remain more focused on short-term financial indicators rather than long-term ESG risk management.

Existing research has focused on green finance’s impact on corporate environmental performance, failing to account for the complex regional mechanisms that shape its contribution to systemic sustainability. This study fills the gaps by examining the mechanism and spatial heterogeneity of green finance’s influences on regional sustainability measured by environmental performance. Using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces during 2010–2022, it shows that green finance increased from 0.318 to 0.539, while environmental performance improved from 0.441 to 0.656. The empirical evidence demonstrates that green finance has a robust positive effect on environmental performance, acting as an effective tool for environmental governance. This impact is primarily channeled through technological innovation and green consumption, with environmental regulation providing a synergistic moderating role. Furthermore, significant regional heterogeneity in sustainability outcomes is observed, while the effect is strongest in eastern China, unstable or negligible in old industrial bases, and unexpectedly negative in ecologically fragile Northwest China. The disparities are attributed to variations in local economic structure, institutional capacity, and development stage. Corresponding policy recommendations include improving the institutional framework, channeling financial resources to green technology R&amp;D and sustainable consumption incentives, integrating green finance with environmental policies, and implementing region-specific strategies. This study offers practical benchmarks for China and other developing economies to leverage green finance as a driver of sustainable development.",297594109,0,37,,

The paper is based on a 5-year longitudinal database for 150 publicly traded agribusiness firms with a total of 750 firm-year observations. The results show that one point increase in the ESG disclosure score is related to an increase in market capitalization by about USD 0.45 billion (p = 0.000). In addition, ESG disclosure has a positive relationship with investor sentiment, with a coefficient of 0.35 (p = 0.000), meaning that the more transparency there is, the more positive the investors' perception. The results also confirm that corporate governance quality is positively associated with the quality and reliability of ESG disclosure, thus promoting long-term investment. Overall, this study underlines the increasing importance of ESG factors in shaping the market performance and investor engagement of agribusiness.

Employing an event study methodology on a sample of 1552 financial restatement events in China’s A-share market from 2013 to 2023, we measure market reactions using the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) over a [−1, +1] day window. Our findings reveal that strong ESG performance significantly mitigates the negative market reactions triggered by financial restatements. However, this protective effect of ESG is significantly weakened by the inconsistency in ESG assessments among rating agencies, known as ESG rating divergence, particularly when such divergence is persistent. We argue that the underlying mechanism is that rating divergence creates signal conflicts, exacerbates information asymmetry, and erodes the credibility of ESG signals. This, in turn, undermines the stakeholder trust and moral capital that underpin the insurance-like effect. This research sheds light on the complex impact of ESG rating divergence on the value-protective mechanism of ESG and contributes new empirical evidence to the literature on ESG and its insurance-like effect, especially within the context of an emerging market.",297806821,0,164,,

 This study investigates the relationship between Generative AI (Gen AI) adoption, leaders’ digital literacy, and responsible innovation practices in shaping organizational culture and behavioral adjustments that directly support sustainable development outcomes (SDOs). The goal is to explore how ethically aligned AI integration, when supported by contextual understanding and workforce readiness, can enhance sustainability efforts.
 
 
 
 The quantitative empirical survey collected data from 450 employees working in social media agencies in Pakistan, through convenience sampling technique within 4 months. The study employs moderation-mediation through the process model, using SmartPLS software.
 
 
 
 All eight hypotheses were supported. The study finds that SDOs are achievable through the integration of cultural, technological and ethical complexities. Responsible innovation practices and a sustainability-focused culture are critical to ensuring Gen AI contributes positively to organizational sustainable goals.
 
 
 
 Practitioners and global trainers should invest in workforce upskilling through digital literacy and AI competency equipping employees to engage with AI technologies, driving innovation and sustainability. Moreover, organizations need to focus on sustainable, ethical and socially beneficial outcomes while minimizing the risk.
 
 
 
 Regulators, with the support of AI solutions, can promote community engagement that runs parallel with societal values, fostering trust and collaboration. Furthermore, policy makers need to promote digital literacy for bridging the gap of digital divide and offer equitable access to all stakeholders, enabling them to benefit from technology.
 
 
 
 This study uniquely integrates Generative AI adoption, leaders' digital literacy, and responsible innovation into a single behavioral framework for sustainable development. By providing empirical evidence from an emerging economy, it advances sustainability literature and offers actionable insights for ethically aligned AI-driven cultural and behavioral transformation.

 This study investigates the relationship between greenwashing (GWS) and the financial performance (FP) of banks in developing economies, focusing on two critical moderating factors: boardroom diversity and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) controversies. Using a sample of 110 listed banks across 18 developing countries from 2012–2013 to 2021–2022, this study employs regression analysis to assess the impact of GWS on FP. The study uses the peer‐relative GWS score by Yu et al. and introduces boardroom diversity and ESG controversies as moderating variables to analyze their influence on the GWS‐FP relationship. The findings reveal that GWS negatively affects the FP of banks in developing economies. Furthermore, the presence of female directors on bank boards moderates this relationship, reducing the financial penalties associated with GWS. ESG controversies, on the other hand, amplify the negative impact of GWS on FP, indicating the importance of a holistic approach to sustainability. This study addresses critical gaps in the literature by examining the nexus between GWS and FP, specifically within the banking sector of developing economies—a context that has received limited attention. Moreover, the study offers novel insights into the governance‐sustainability‐performance dynamic in the banking sector.",297878987,0,65,,
10.3390/accountaudit2010002,The Impact of ESG Factors on Corporate Credit Risk: An Empirical Analysis of European Firms Using the Altman Z-Score,"Cinzia Baldan, Francesco Zen, Margherita Targhetta",Accounting and Auditing,2026,"Background: The increasing integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into financial decision-making has prompted debate over their impact on corporate credit risk. While many studies suggest that ESG performance may enhance firms’ resilience, empirical evidence remains mixed due to data inconsistency and methodological heterogeneity and differences in time horizons over which ESG effects materialise. Methods: The study investigates the relationship between ESG performance and credit risk using a panel of European firms from 2020 to 2024, a phase highly characterised by substantial macroeconomic shocks. The Altman Z-score serves as a proxy for default risk, while ESG data are sourced from Refinitiv Eikon. Four fixed-effects panel regressions are estimated: a baseline model using aggregate ESG scores, an extended model with financial controls, and disaggregated and sector-specific models. Results: The findings indicate that ESG scores—either aggregated or by pillar—show limited statistical significance in explaining variations in the Z-score. In contrast, financial variables such as solvency, liquidity, and cash flow ratios display strong, positive, and significant effects on credit stability. Some heterogeneous sectoral effects emerge: social factors are positive in technology, while governance has a negative impact in basic materials. Conclusions: ESG initiatives may not yield immediate improvements in default risk metrics, particularly over short and crisis-dominated periods, but could enhance financial resilience over time. Combining ESG information with traditional financial ratios remains essential; the results underscore the importance of consistent and high-quality ESG disclosure to reduce measurement error and enhance comparability across firms.",297957301,0,25,,

Using panel data from NEV companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share markets between 2011 and 2022, this study applies text mining techniques to construct a fintech index and analyze the transmission mechanisms through which fintech influences ESG performance. The findings show that fintech directly improves ESG outcomes for NEV companies, a result that remains robust across a series of validation tests. The analysis reveals that fintech reduces financing constraints and enhances corporate environmental information disclosure, which in turn drives better ESG performance. Furthermore, the impact of fintech is particularly pronounced in state-owned enterprises, large-scale firms, and technologically advanced NEV companies, as evidenced by heterogeneity analysis. This study provides empirical insights into fintech’s role in advancing sustainable development in the NEV sector, offering guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders aiming to align technological progress with environmental and social governance objectives.",283049146,16,42,,

Despite this growing interest, significant gaps persist in understanding the motivations behind ESG disclosure, specific practices, and the consequences it causes from a supply chain management (SCM) perspective. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 64 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2024. Using the belief–action–outcome framework, our review identified several SCM-related beliefs that drive firms' ESG disclosures. We also detailed specific practices and outcomes at the supply chain level. Additionally, the review synthesized various SCM-related enablers and barriers to ESG disclosure. Finally, we integrated these insights into a conceptual framework and developed a research agenda to explore ESG further within the SCM context. This research represents the first comprehensive review to systematically analyze ESG disclosure with SCM, making a significant contribution to the ESG in the SCM research stream and laying a robust foundation for future studies.",282135432,13,146,,

While research explores the connection between ESG scores and financial outcomes, the role of ESG disclosures in mediating this relationship remains unclear. This study bridges this gap by systematically reviewing the impact of ESG disclosures on firm value and profitability across various industries. We employed a rigorous selection process based on the PRISMA framework, searching Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant studies. Ultimately, 52 studies were analyzed to determine the relationship between ESG disclosures and financial performance. The results reveal a nuanced dynamic. Industries like food and retail showed positive correlations between strong ESG disclosures and improved financial performance. The utility sector displayed high accounting performance linked to social metrics, with less focus on environmental disclosures. Interestingly, the connection between ESG and financial performance in developing economies was either negative or insignificant. The agriculture sector presented a unique case where governance disclosures specifically enhanced market performance. This multi-industry exploration underscores the need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach when analyzing ESG performance. We recommend policy measures that consider specific industry characteristics and contextual factors to enhance the quality and transparency of ESG disclosures.",278281179,31,92,,

Khatib, Бо Лю",Business Strategy & Development,2024,"Abstract This study is designed to conduct a systematic literature review aimed at assessing the influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on firm value. Although previous studies have explored their relationship, a comprehensive systematic review on this topic is still lacking. We conducted a detailed literature search in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and identified 73 papers published between 2016 and 2023 as the sample, covering annual trends, country and industry distribution, theoretical frameworks, proxy variables, research methods, research results, and provided direction for future research. We found a significant increase in the number of studies over the past 3 years. Cross‐country studies dominated the field, with most research adopting multi‐industry analysis, while studies focusing on a single industry were relatively rare. The stakeholder theory and agency theory were the most widely applied theories. Most studies showed that ESG performance had a positive effect on firm value, reflecting the growing importance that markets and investors placed on ESG performance and its contribution to long‐term firm growth. However, some studies reported negative or insignificant effects, noting that the effects of ESG performance varied by industry, region, and market environment. This study suggests that future research should explore the independent and interactive effects of each ESG dimension on firm value, focusing on dynamic relationships across industries and regions, using new methods and models, and incorporating moderating variables. This study provides practical guidance for firm managers and policymakers to optimize ESG practices, enhancing firm value and promoting sustainability.",279781517,19,71,,
