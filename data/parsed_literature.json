As these systems scale globally, they must operate across languages, regulatory regimes, and heterogeneous data sources while maintaining auditability and cost efficiency (Leippold et al., 2022, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2022.03.008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2022.03.008)).\n\nThis literature review examines research on verification-oriented reasoning agents that combine neural models, external evidence retrieval, and explicit control mechanisms. The scope covers retrieval-augmented reasoning, hallucination mitigation, multilingual transfer, and cost-aware decision policies, with a focus on financial and regulatory intelligence.

        "section_text": "Early automated reasoning systems in finance were predominantly rule-based, encoding compliance logic and accounting constraints explicitly but lacking scalability and robustness to linguistic variation (Baldwin et al., 2006, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intacc.2006.03.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intacc.2006.03.002)). The rise of statistical NLP and later deep learning shifted emphasis toward probabilistic inference from text and numerical data, enabling large-scale processing but weakening guarantees of logical correctness (LeCun et al., 2015, [https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539)).\n\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) further amplified this trade-off by enabling fluent reasoning-like outputs while introducing systematic hallucination and overconfidence, particularly in domains where factual grounding is essential (Maynez et al., 2020, [https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.173](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.173)). These failures motivated renewed interest in verification-centric architectures that explicitly separate reasoning from evidence validation (Ji et al., 2023, [https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730](https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730)).\n\n---"

RAG systems assume that access to relevant documents implicitly constrains model outputs, an assumption shown to improve factual accuracy in open-domain question answering (Izacard & Grave, 2021, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01282)).\n\nIn multilingual settings, cross-lingual transformers enable transfer across languages by learning shared representations, reducing the need for language-specific pipelines (Devlin et al., 2019, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)).

Conversely, insufficient retrieval leads to hallucinated reasoning chains, particularly when models rely on parametric knowledge rather than verifiable sources (Ji et al., 2023, [https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730](https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730)).\n\nThese limitations motivated the development of adaptive and confidence-aware verification strategies, where models dynamically decide whether external evidence is required based on internal uncertainty or disagreement signals (Manakul et al., 2023, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896)).

Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) methods explicitly introduced verification stages to re-evaluate generated claims against retrieved sources, reducing factual errors in controlled settings (Dhuliawala et al., 2023, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495)).\n\nMore recent agentic frameworks integrate planning, retrieval, and verification into multi-step controllers, enabling conditional execution of expensive operations (Yao et al., 2023, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)).

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been widely adopted to extract ESG-related signals from annual reports, sustainability disclosures, and regulatory filings, enabling large-scale analysis beyond manual auditing capabilities (D\u00edaz-Rainey et al., 2020, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121402](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121402)).\n\nHowever, multiple studies demonstrate that ESG disclosures frequently contain symbolic or aspirational language that is weakly correlated with measurable outcomes, leading to unreliable analytics when textual signals are interpreted without verification against structured financial data (Michelon et al., 2015, [https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.1865](https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.1865)).

This design choice allows models to achieve high classification accuracy while remaining agnostic to whether extracted claims correspond to reported facts, creating a pathway for hallucinated or unsupported claims to propagate into downstream reasoning systems (Ji et al., 2023, [https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730](https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730)).\n\nConstraint-aware extraction was proposed to address this gap by enforcing explicit validity conditions on extracted claims, ensuring alignment between textual assertions and formally reported financial structures (Ganchev et al., 2010, [https://jmlr.org/papers/v11/ganchev10a.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v11/ganchev10a.html)).

The rise of statistical learning and later deep learning shifted emphasis toward data-driven prediction, largely abandoning explicit rule representations in favor of end-to-end optimization (LeCun et al., 2015, [https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14539)).\n\nIn financial NLP, transformer-based models such as domain-adapted BERT variants achieved state-of-the-art performance on sentiment and disclosure classification tasks, but operated independently of formal accounting or regulatory logic (Araci, 2019, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063)).

Early studies demonstrated that news sentiment and media tone contained predictive signals not immediately reflected in prices (Tetlock, 2007, [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01232.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2007.01232.x)).

        "section_text": "Despite their empirical success, dominant multimodal approaches face several limitations. Feature-level fusion often assumes linear or static relationships between modalities, failing to capture context-dependent relevance of textual information during different market regimes (Krauss et al., 2017, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.031](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.031)). Moreover, sentiment-based representations may oversimplify complex narratives such as earnings guidance or regulatory risk disclosures.\n\nThese shortcomings have motivated alternative approaches that frame financial decision making as a sequential decision problem rather than a pointwise prediction task. Reinforcement learning and policy-based methods explicitly model the interaction between actions and future returns, addressing limitations of myopic classification-based strategies (Moody & Saffell, 2001, [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2000/hash/7f39f8317fbdb1988ef4c628eba02591-Abstract.html](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2000/hash/7f39f8317fbdb1988ef4c628eba02591-Abstract.html)).\n\n---"

Text-augmented models improve responsiveness to news shocks but introduce noise when textual signals are ambiguous or contradictory.\n\nReinforcement learning-based trading agents demonstrate superior cumulative returns in simulated environments but exhibit sensitivity to reward design and market non-stationarity (Li et al., 2019, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2018.10.039](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2018.10.039)).

        "section_text": "Datasets for financial decision making typically consist of synchronized price series and textual corpora aligned at daily or intraday frequencies. Evaluation practices increasingly emphasize portfolio-level metrics rather than classification accuracy, reflecting the economic objectives of trading systems (Moody & Saffell, 2001, [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2000/hash/7f39f8317fbdb1988ef4c628eba02591-Abstract.html](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2000/hash/7f39f8317fbdb1988ef4c628eba02591-Abstract.html)).\n\nCumulative Return and risk-adjusted metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio are widely used to assess profitability and volatility trade-offs, while Maximum Drawdown captures downside risk (Sharpe, 1966, [https://doi.org/10.3905/jpm.1966.409096](https://doi.org/10.3905/jpm.1966.409096)). However, these metrics implicitly assume frictionless markets and often neglect transaction costs and liquidity constraints, introducing evaluation bias.\n\n---"

Additionally, interpretability remains limited, complicating trust and adoption in regulated financial environments.\n\nAnother open challenge concerns evaluation realism, as backtesting frameworks often fail to account for slippage, transaction costs, and market impact, potentially overstating real-world performance (Krauss et al., 2017, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.031](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.031)).\n\n---"

There is also growing interest in multimodal transformers that jointly model time-series and text within unified architectures, enabling dynamic modality weighting.\n\nAdditionally, constraint-aware and risk-sensitive decision models aim to incorporate regulatory and portfolio constraints explicitly, reflecting practical investment considerations beyond raw return maximization.\n\n---"

Conversely, for exploratory analysis and scenario generation, simulation-based and agent-based market models provide complementary insights but lack direct action optimization.\n\nHybrid paradigms combining statistical finance, textual analysis, and decision-theoretic modeling represent a promising synthesis, situating multimodal financial decision making within a broader ecosystem of trustworthy financial AI.\n\n---"
