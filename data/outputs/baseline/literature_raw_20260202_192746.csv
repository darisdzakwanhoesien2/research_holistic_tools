A significant trend is that construction projects have been transformed and upgraded to the digital and smart mode in the whole life cycle. As a critical technology for the construction industry’s innovative development, building information modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in building design, construction, and operation. BIM has gained much interest in the research field of smart buildings in recent years. However, the dimensions of BIM and smart building applications have not been explored thoroughly so far. With an in-depth review of related journal articles published from 1996 to July 2020 on the BIM applications for smart buildings, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding and critical thinking about the nexus of BIM and smart buildings. This paper proposes a framework with three dimensions for the nexus of BIM application in smart buildings, including BIM attributes, project phases, and smart attributes. According to the three dimensions, this paper elaborates on (1) the advantages of BIM for achieving various smartness; (2) applications of BIM in multiple phases of smart buildings; and (3) smart building functions that be achieved with BIM. Based on the analysis of the literature in three dimensions, this paper presents the cross-analysis of the nexus of BIM and smart buildings. Lastly, this paper proposes the critical insights and implications about the research gaps and research trends: (1) enhancing the interoperability of BIM software; (2) further exploring the role of BIM in the operation and refurbishment phase of smart buildings; (3) paying attention to BIM technology in the field of transportation infrastructure; (4) clarifying the economic benefits of BIM projects; and (5) integrating BIM and other technologies.",122754541,91,107,,NUS - Xu

However, this paradigm shift also entails novel challenges and prospects for streamlining processes, augmenting efficiency, and ultimately driving success across production workflows and logistical operations. Dynamic supply chains necessitate unimpeded access to high-quality, dependable data to facilitate real-time, data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, owing to their inherently intricate nature, these supply chains are subject to a heightened vulnerability to disruptions and delays, surpassing those encountered in traditional supply chains. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a framework that synthesises the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), and blockchain technology (BCT) into a cohesive and integrated system, thereby optimising the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management operations. The proposed framework takes cognisance of the challenges inherent in ensuring information traceability, mitigating fragmented information, enhancing interoperability, and fortifying reliability throughout the design, production, and implementation phases of assets within dynamic supply chains operating in the offsite manufacturing domain. To illustrate the efficacy of our proposition, we present a framework that exemplifies the seamless integration of a permissioned, open-source distributed ledger, which forms the bedrock of our support infrastructure for IoT and BIM integration. Through rigorous analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of the developed framework in the form of a designed Supply Chain Management Model (SCMM-PDO), which harmonises the physical, digital, and operational layers within a robust system architecture (BCT.IoT-BIM). The integration of these technologies provides a decentralised solution, reinforcing supply chains with improved security, reliability, and quality control mechanisms, thus enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain network. It is anticipated that this transformative integration will yield substantial improvements in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as operational efficiency, cost reduction, and the cultivation of trust and accountability across supply chain activities. The research proposes an IoT and BIM conceptual framework that simulates the dynamic supply chain operations, facilitating real-time analysis and prediction of supply chain participants' behaviours from resources, processes, and assets. Furthermore, the integration of IoT-BIM (digital twinning) with a blockchain-based system, such as Hyperledger Fabric, engenders a secure and transparent framework for the diligent tracking of assets and information throughout the supply chain. The findings of this study offer an all-encompassing conceptual framework for the secure and transparent tracking of asset information by integrating Blockchain-based technologies with IoT and BIM. This research endeavour thus expands the existing body of knowledge, establishing a foundation for future investigations within this proliferating field.",269588211,88,108,,NUS - Xu

As the most cutting-edge off-site construction, modular buildings have been utilised for residential building, student accommodation, and hotel projects. However, because of existing and underlying constraints, the adoption of modular buildings is still relatively low. To reveal factors hindering the development of high-rise modular buildings, a comprehensive literature review, coupled with a focus group study, were conducted. A questionnaire survey inquiring about all stakeholders was implemented to quantify constraints. The results were further examined according to a real-life case study. This paper manifested that “Lack of coordination and communication among stakeholders”, “Higher cost”, “Lack of government support”, “Lack of experience and expertise”, “Lack of building codes and standards”, “Poor supply chain integration”, and “Complexity of connection” are the top barriers curbing the uptake of modular buildings.

However, the overall status remains not satisfactory and has a great potential for further improvement. In this circumstance, the aim of this study is proposing solutions for further improvement of effective C&D waste management in Hong Kong. Based on a comprehensive content analysis of seven selected countries and two rounds of focus group meetings with local experienced professionals, prevailing C&D waste management policies and successful practices were identified and their feasibility of implementation in Hong Kong was discussed. Results revealed that non‐inert waste recycling is a key for improving the C&D waste management in Hong Kong to a higher level. A “3R + I” principle was suggested to be implemented in Hong Kong instead of the currently employed “3R” principle. Four solutions, namely promulgation of more specialized regulations, adoption of advanced recycling technologies, development of mature recycling markets, and implementation of high landfilling costs, were identified as the key directions for future improvement of C&D waste management in Hong Kong.

Traditional practice is rather unproductive, involving the work of several different trades crowded in situ and delivered sequentially one after another. To enhance productivity in IDC, offsite practice is receiving increasing attention as a process innovation along with Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA), an emerging concept in the industry. This paper aims to investigate offsite IDC practice and develop a set of DfMA enablers for better achieving this building process. It undertakes a literature review, case study, and 18 semi-structured interviews. To support the offsite IDC and its production line, standardized procedure, automated machinery, and supply chain, 10 DfMA enablers are adopted, such as early collaboration, design standardization and simplification, and light material selection. These findings indicate a paradigm shift not only in interior design methodology but also in IDC professional practice process. This research enriches the literature on DfMA and IDC, in particular their synergy, and offers a new model for interior designers and offsite IDC practitioners.",227377266,72,55,,NUS - Xu

Hosamo, Henrik Nielsen, P. R. Svennevig, K. Svidt",Advances in Building Energy Research,2022,"ABSTRACT This study proposes a novel Digital Twin framework of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVACDT) system to reduce energy consumption while increasing thermal comfort. The framework is developed to help the facility managers better understand the building operation to enhance the HVAC system function. The Digital Twin framework is based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) combined with a newly created plug-in to receive real-time sensor data as well as thermal comfort and optimization process through Matlab programming. In order to determine if the suggested framework is practical, data were collected from a Norwegian office building between August 2019 and October 2021 and used to test the framework. An artificial neural network (ANN) in a Simulink model and a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) are then used to improve the HVAC system. The HVAC system is comprised of air distributors, cooling units, heating units, pressure regulators, valves, air gates, and fans, among other components. In this context, several characteristics, such as temperatures, pressure, airflow, cooling and heating operation control, and other factors are considered as decision variables. In order to determine objective functions, the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the HVAC energy usage are both calculated. As a result, ANN's decision variables and objective function correlated well. Furthermore, MOGA presents different design factors that can be used to obtain the best possible solution in terms of thermal comfort and energy usage. The results show that the average cooling energy savings for four days in summer is roughly 13.2%, and 10.8% for the three summer months (June, July, and August), keeping the PPD under 10%. Finally, compared to traditional approaches, the HVACDT framework displays a higher level of automation in terms of data management.",251480217,70,136,,NUS - Xu

Aziz",Buildings,2022,"As a multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can assist construction organizations in improving their project’s quality, optimize collaboration efficiency, and reduce construction periods and expenditure. Given the distinguished contributions of BIM utilization, there is a trend that BIM has significant potential to be utilized in the construction phase of green buildings. Compared with traditional buildings, green buildings have more stringent requirements, including environmental protection, saving energy, and residents’ comfort. Although BIM is deemed an effective method to achieve the abovementioned requirements in the construction process of green buildings, there are few systematic reviews that explore the capabilities of BIM in the construction phase of green buildings. This has hindered the utilization of BIM in the construction of green buildings. To bridge this research gap and review the latest BIM capabilities, this study was developed to perform a systematic review of the BIM capabilities in the construction phase of green buildings. In this systematic review, the PRISMA protocol has been used as the primary procedure for article screening and review. The entire systematic review was performed from January 2022 to April 2022. In this process, 165 articles were included, reviewed, and discussed. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were adopted as the databases. Through this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have significant advantages in project quality improvement, lifecycle data storage and management, collaboration optimization, planning, and schedule management optimization in the construction phase of green buildings. Through the discussion, it can be concluded that BIM utilization can be adopted from the pre-construction phase to the post-construction stage in the green building construction process. Besides these, the barriers to BIM utilization in the green building construction phase are also revealed in the discussion section, including the non-uniform data format, insufficient interactivity, ambiguous ownership, insufficient BIM training, and hesitation toward BIM adoption.

The average rate of COVID-19 vaccination intention was 73.19%, ranging from 31% to 88.86%. Attitude had the strongest association with vaccination intention (r+ = 0.487, 95% CI: 0.368–0.590), followed by subjective norms (r+ = 0.409, 95% CI: 0.300–0.507), and perceived behavioral control (r+ = 0.286, 95% CI: 0.198–0.369). Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled effect sizes of TPB constructs on vaccination intention varied across geographic regions and study populations. Attitude had large effect sizes in Asia, Europe, and Oceania, especially among the adult general population, parents, and patients. Subjective norms had large effect sizes in Asia and Oceania, especially among parents and patients. Perceived behavioral control was the most dominant predictor of vaccination acceptance in Africa among patients.

10.3390/su13169219,DfMA: Towards an Integrated Strategy for a More Productive and Sustainable Construction Industry in Australia,"C. Langston, Weiwei Zhang",Sustainability,2021,"Design for manufacture and assembly (DfMA) is an important part of the future of the construction industry due to the promise of speed of project delivery, quality control, worker safety, and waste minimization onsite via the purposeful design for manufacture and assembly offsite. However, the adoption of DfMA in Australia has been slow. This paper investigates the barriers prohibiting widespread uptake and how digital construction will be a catalyst for improving use on commercial-scale projects. A total of six leading experts were interviewed to elicit their opinions, and seven recent case studies of high-rise modular apartment and hotel buildings constructed by Hickory were cross-referenced as evidence of DfMA capability. The experts suggested that the reasons for slow adoption in Australia were community mindset, government regulations and incentives, planning and building codes, unionization and business politics, finance, and supply chain management. The case studies suggest that compatible building type and transportation distance are also factors. These barriers can be addressed by the clever integration of building information modelling tools with lean construction processes as part of a proposed strategy leading to smarter (more productive) and better (more sustainable) outcomes predicated on growth in digital construction practices. The paper concludes with a proposed framework for change that conceptualizes the ‘ecosystem’ needed to support widespread DfMA in the Australian context, including the paradigm shift from building to manufacturing/assembly, the displacement of workers from onsite to offsite activity, and the expansion of interdisciplinary design and construct collaboration.",117728879,53,65,,NUS - Xu

COVID-19 has severely affected many industries, including construction and demolition (C&D) waste management and C&D waste resource recovery sector. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and schemes alike are policy instruments that prevent waste generation and promote a circular economy in the construction industry. These schemes are long adopted in various countries for different waste streams. EPR policy development and implementation, particularly for C&D waste, is still at an early stage in Australia. This study aims to review the Australian regulatory environment and practice to identify barriers and enablers towards successful policy development and implementation of C&D waste-related EPR. This study is based on secondary data that are publicly available. The document analysis was conducted to identify the level of regulatory and other stakeholders support in Australia. Following three rounds of examination of sources and applying multiple selection criteria, 59 different sources were reviewed in total. The results showed that there is widespread support among different stakeholders to develop EPR and expand the existing regulation to other materials. The barriers were cost and time implications for EPR policy establishment and enforcement, diversity of stakeholders involved, construction product lifecycle, responsibility of manufacturers, complexity in implantation of EPR regulations, modification inbuilt facilities and health and safety issues. Recommendations are made to alleviate these challenges. The outcome of this study could serve as a guideline for designing effective EPR policies.",212165001,51,62,,NUS - Xu

Challenges such as production inefficiency and inadequate waste management hinder advancement in the construction industry. Furthermore, the sector has emerged as one of the largest producers of waste in the world, which can lead to detrimental impacts on the economy and the environment. Conventional approaches are insufficient to eradicate these concerns. Thus, practitioners have sought to implement novel methods to ameliorate the construction process. In this regard, design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) and design for deconstruction (DfD) have gained prominence, as studies have elucidated the methods’ unprecedented potential to wholly transform the construction process and mitigate the unwanted impacts brought about by the industry. This study identified the applications and benefits of DfMA and DfD in construction, as well as recent developments and research gaps, through a literature review, using Scopus as the primary database and MATLAB for conducting data text analytics. The current body of knowledge necessitates a further assessment of the following research gaps: (1) development of standard construction-oriented DfMA guidelines; (2) corroboration of the developed DfMA tools through practical application; (3) integration of these holistic design approaches with emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing and digital fabrication; (4) comparison of structures constructed using DfMA and DfD with structures built with conventional approaches; (5) comprehensive application of DfD guidelines to structural systems; (6) integration of DfMA and DfD; (7) execution of sustainability assessment studies to evaluate the impact of DfMA and DfD; and (8) identification of solutions to the barriers to DfMA and DfD uptake in construction.",259374462,49,114,,NUS - Xu

Ali, Islam H. El-adaway",Construction Management and Economics,2022,"Abstract Blockchain represents an evolving technology for distributed and secure recording and sharing of information. Meanwhile, blockchain has thrived in banking, finance, and supply chain; its usage within the construction industry is still in its infancy. To this end, the existing literature falls short in providing comprehensive quantitative understanding, within a systems-based analytic context, of the factors affecting blockchain utilization in construction applications. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors: (1) conducted an extensive literature review on blockchain implementation in the construction domain; (2) identified a list of 41 factors affecting blockchain implementation in construction projects categorized in four categories: challenges, needs, requirements, and capabilities; (3) utilized a social network analysis (SNA) approach on a database of 111 publications to quantitatively analyze the literature as related to the aforementioned factors; and (4) performed clustering analysis on the SNA graphs to determine the combinations of factors that are most likely co-occurring in research publications. SNA results indicate that while the most investigated factor was “increased trust and transparency between project parties”, the least studied factors included: “cash upfront funding system”, “change payment processes and procedures”, “smart contracts design errors”, “cryptocurrency fluctuations”, “lack of sufficiently skilled personnel”, and “increased awareness and capabilities of personnel”. Also, clustering outcomes highlight that some combinations of factors are not well-represented in current scholarly efforts. Such imbalance and consequent knowledge gaps may contribute to the actual implementation rate of blockchain in construction applications. Ultimately, this paper provides a roadmap for potential future directions of blockchain construction-related research.",190118083,49,150,,NUS - Xu

This study estimates the penalty-cost based on the produced C&D wastes in steel and concrete skeleton projects. Field survey and the BOQ data were collected from five concrete and four steel skeleton projects. The difference of materials used and wastes generated between concrete and steel skeleton projects were evaluated statistically (ANOVA and Welch and Brown-Forsythe). A financial analysis was implemented for estimating the penalty cost. The study outcomes demonstrate that the amount of waste that construction managers estimated is significantly lower than the actual amount generated. Furthermore, 0.055% of the total project cost of a penalty was estimated based on the waste produced at construction sites. In the end, the estimated penalty was validated by comparing it with the six recent completed projects. The penalty calculated in this study could save the project cost and reduce the C&D waste. As a result, imposing the estimated cost as a penalty would force construction managers to think thoroughly about the generated C&D waste problems. This study also has a novelty and will add to the body of knowledge by using penalty-cost quantification model to save project-cost of construction material-based-waste, and it can be further explored by adopting more quality data and engaging different construction materials.",58405865,46,59,,NUS - Xu

In the history of BIM, there have been a number of important, epoch-making events that have changed the direction of BIM. From the concept of BIM, to the technology used in construction, to the methodology, to the process, to the holistic idea of BIM, one can see the evolution of user approaches to its use. BIM has two dimensions: an information system and a philosophy. Thus, BIM is both a tool and a philosophy that brings about a revolution. Several decades of BIM development prompts reflection and the delineation of perhaps some stages of maturation. This paper presents a theory of cognition (epistemology), essential for understanding the history of BIM. The genesis of the separation of BIM from CAD makes it clear that specific factors influenced further developments. Thus, the aim of the study was to periodise BIM in view of various factors that may be relevant to researchers interested in BIM and companies using or implementing BIM. The literature survey maintained inclusivity to reflect both positive and critical aspects of BIM. The periodisation of the history of BIM was done due to 3 factors: idea, approach and organisational culture. The development of the BIM idea established the direction in which systems and software development was heading, the user approach forced interoperability and the organisational culture emphasised increasing efficiency. Working according to the openBIM approach or within an IPD framework is probably not the end of the anticipated level of BIM maturity. The division into periods will probably be the subject of much discussion, but will perhaps set the directions for the future.",267929849,46,67,,NUS - Xu

Sustainability research in off-site construction (SROSC) is crucial for its development and is a nonnegligible part of its management. However, an in-depth understanding and critical analysis of SROSC to summarize recent research and inform future research directions are lacking. In this study, we address this issue by offering a mixed-review method integrating scientometric analysis and systematic review to explore state-of-the-art SROSC. We aim to uncover sustainability themes and topics, distinguish research trends, and identify gaps in knowledge that can be addressed in future research. Scientometric analysis was used to perform statistical analysis and visual map research on the knowledge landscape formed by 272 related studies of SROSC. The systematic review was used to identify and analyze six major knowledge themes (e.g., environmental, economic, social, decision-making, optimization, and industry management) and 21 knowledge topics for SROSC. We proposed possible future research directions based on the resulting structured body of knowledge. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by visualizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art of SROSC, as well as identifying the future research directions in this area to improve architectural, engineering, and construction practices.

The emergence of big data has made recycling and waste management easier and more efficient. The growth in worldwide food waste has led to vital economic, social, and environmental effects, and has gained the interest of researchers. Although previous studies have explored the influence of big data on industrial performance, this issue has not been explored in the context of recycling and waste management in the food industry. In addition, no studies have explored the influence of BDPA on the performance and competitive advantage of the food waste and the recycling industry. Specifically, the impact of big data on environmental and economic performance has received little attention. This research develops a new model based on the resource-based view, technology-organization-environment, and human organization technology theories to address the gap in this research area. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is used to analyze the data. The findings reveal that both the human factor, represented by employee knowledge, and environmental factor, represented by competitive pressure, are essential drivers for evaluating the BDPA adoption by waste and recycling organizations. In addition, the impact of BDPA adoption on competitive advantage, environmental performance, and economic performance are significant. The results indicate that BDPA capability enhances an organization’s competitive advantage by enhancing its environmental and economic performance.

It adopts a design thinking method to develop the guidelines from literature, brainstorming, action research, case study, and most importantly, dynamic iteration thereof. The results affirm the impact of DfCWM on not only preventing construction waste generation effectively but reducing the construction cost without jeopardizing the design. However, its implementation is not merely a simple linear process and requires coordination from all stakeholders. For practitioners, this research also provides the DfCWM guidelines to be a design companion, encouraging deliberation of an entire building and material life cycle with special consideration given to waste minimization.

Shang, Fan Xue",Remote Sensing,2021,"Coarse registration of 3D point clouds plays an indispensable role for parametric, semantically rich, and realistic digital twin buildings (DTBs) in the practice of GIScience, manufacturing, robotics, architecture, engineering, and construction. However, the existing methods have prominently been challenged by (i) the high cost of data collection for numerous existing buildings and (ii) the computational complexity from self-similar layout patterns. This paper studies the registration of two low-cost data sets, i.e., colorful 3D point clouds captured by smartphones and 2D CAD drawings, for resolving the first challenge. We propose a novel method named ‘Registration based on Architectural Reflection Detection’ (RegARD) for transforming the self-symmetries in the second challenge from a barrier of coarse registration to a facilitator. First, RegARD detects the innate architectural reflection symmetries to constrain the rotations and reduce degrees of freedom. Then, a nonlinear optimization formulation together with advanced optimization algorithms can overcome the second challenge. As a result, high-quality coarse registration and subsequent low-cost DTBs can be created with semantic components and realistic appearances. Experiments showed that the proposed method outperformed existing methods considerably in both effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., 49.88% less error and 73.13% less time, on average. The RegARD presented in this paper first contributes to coarse registration theories and exploitation of symmetries and textures in 3D point clouds and 2D CAD drawings. For practitioners in the industries, RegARD offers a new automatic solution to utilize ubiquitous smartphone sensors for massive low-cost DTBs.",29238525,40,69,,NUS - Xu

10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105338,BIM-based preassembly analysis for design for manufacturing and assembly of prefabricated bridges,"Duy–Cuong Nguyen, Chi-Ho Jeon, Gi-Tae Roh, Chang-Su Shim",Automation in Construction,2024,"Prefabricated structures have garnered attention in bridge construction owing to their advantages in quality control, cost-effectiveness, and ability to save time. However, assembling prefabricated structures often leads to critical errors that are only discovered during the actual assembly on the construction site. These errors arise from the absence of an effective preassembly verification method, compounded by the inherent fabrication deviation of the different suppliers of prefabricated components. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach involving the integration of the design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) principles and parametric building information modeling (BIM) to develop a preassembly analysis system (PAS). The DfMA methodology enables a seamless information exchange throughout the design–fabrication–assembly process and facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the assemblability of prefabricated structures based on design and fabrication deviation data. Data-driven BIM modeling is leveraged to incorporate the DfMA requirements into the BIM model through customized data templates and user-defined parameters. The PAS is validated through a case study focused on a prefabricated bridge, wherein the potential assembly errors of girders and coupling of decks and girders are examined based on the accumulated fabrication deviation of the connection parts, such as shear pockets and shear connectors. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the PAS in identifying and mitigating assembly errors. Ultimately, this study presents a crucial step toward automated assembly-aware fabrication and lays the foundation for the integration of DfMA and parametric BIM, which enables an enhanced information exchange and reduces onsite assembly errors during prefabricated bridge construction.",270831402,38,44,,NUS - Xu

Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, there is a greater need to explore and implement effective strategies to promote a wider adoption of BIM. However, increasing the willingness of project participants to adopt BIM through event management has not received much attention. Therefore, based on event system theory and innovation diffusion theory, we developed a model to explore the influence of the COVID-19 crisis on the willingness of AEC participants to adopt BIM. Structural equation modelling was performed to test the hypotheses. The results demonstrate that the intention of the AEC project participants to adopt BIM is directly driven by the COVID-19 event criticality and perceived usefulness of BIM. Moreover, the event criticality and BIM technical features (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity) can indirectly affect this intention, through the perceived usefulness. However, the impact of event disruption and novelty on the BIM adoption intention is not significant. Several recommendations are provided to improve the BIM adoption intention of AEC participants during and after the pandemic.",228748063,37,90,,NUS - Xu

Many studies have attempted to quantify UMS but they often fall short in accuracy, primarily owing to the lack of proper quantification methods or good data available at a micro level. This research aims to develop a simple but satisfactory model for UMS quantification by focusing on individual buildings. Generally, it is a “bottom‐up” approach that uses building features to proximate the material stocks of individual buildings. The research benefits from a set of valuable, “post‐mortem” ground truth data related to 71 buildings that have been demolished in Hong Kong. By comparing a series of machine learning‐based models, a multiple linear regression model with six building features, namely building type, building year, height, perimeter, total floor area, and total floor number, is found to yield a satisfactory estimate of building material stocks with a mean absolute percentage error of 9.1%, root‐mean‐square error of 474.13, and R‐square of 0.93. The major contribution of this research is to predict a building's material stock based on several easy‐to‐obtain building features. The methodology of machine learning regression is novel. The model provides a useful reference for quantifying UMS in other regions. Future explorations are recommended to calibrate the model when data in these regions is available.",252498161,36,75,,NUS - Xu

Ordieres Meré, Cali Nuur",Sustainability,2020,"The transport sector accounts for a large share of global Co2 emissions. To mitigate the impact of climate change, several sustainability-oriented large-scale infrastructure projects such as electric road systems and expanding rail systems have recently been on the policy agenda. A parallel development that is expected to accelerate the transition of the transport sector is digitalization, which, although ongoing for many decades, has recently been augmented by concepts such as artificial intelligence (AI) and smart city technologies. The integration of these digitalization tools at the organizational level poses not only opportunities but also some challenges for the actors involved in infrastructure projects. An approach that is currently promoted in the infrastructure sector is the Building Information Model (BIM), which is a decision-making instrument that leverages various digitalization tools and applications. However, although the economic implications of BIM are widely discussed in the literature, the (inter-) organizational dynamics involving multiple actors in infrastructure projects are not fully grasped. Large infrastructure projects are sociotechnical endeavors embedded in complex institutional frames; hence the institutional norms, practices and logics in them are significant. Responding to this, this paper adopted an institutional analysis and put the BIM approach in the (inter-) organizational context in infrastructure delivery. Drawing on empirical data from three organizations in infrastructure delivery in Spain, this paper analyzed the tensions among actors during BIM adoption and implementation.",191893814,36,78,,NUS - Xu

Existing studies have extensively investigated the readiness of single DT, but with limited types of DT and a lack of practicability for construction practitioners. Based on a questionnaire survey, we developed a readiness model and a self-assessment tool for assessing DT readiness for construction companies. Among the 15 indicators of DT readiness surveyed, ‘organizational culture’, ‘leadership and top management support’ and ‘top management’s perception’ were identified as the three most critical indicators. Using factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation approaches, the readiness model incorporates 15 critical indicators within two groups, quantified weightings, membership functions and criticality indices. The self-assessment tool was developed and validated to assess DT readiness for construction companies based on objective weightings, pinpointing where changes are needed in response to technological disruptions and digitalization transformation. This study incorporates both individual and organizational indicators in a novel organizational DT readiness model and provides a self-assessment tool for construction organizations when adopting multiple DT.

This approach aims to tackle issues inherent in the design of traditional construction methods, such as low productivity and quality, poor predictability and building performance, and energy use, through the implementation of a BIM library of off-site components. In recent years, a renewed interest has been directed to the attempt to provide solutions to these urgent problems through the adoption of new advancements in technologies. However, while there are studies focussing on a BIM-DfMA approach, there is a lack of research regarding how this approach should be adopted during the whole lifecycle of the assets. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, defining an efficient way of developing a component-based BIM object library has not yet been included in any of the available studies. A mixed methodology approach has been used in this research. A conceptual framework was developed as the result of an extensive literature review to investigate new advancements in the AEC sector. Following the literature review, the framework was tested and validated through a case study based on the production and adoption of a BIM library of off-site components at the design stage of an asset. The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has recognised the necessity of a new approach that helps to resolve the well-known issues presented in traditional methods of construction. The conceptual framework and case study proposed presents a valuable new method of construction that support the implementation of a BIM and DfMA approach, highlighting their benefits. This framework has been created using many valuable and reliable sources of information. The result of this research supports the idea of a novel new construction method that focuses on a manufacturing-digital-driven industry, with the use of DfMA in a BIM-integrated approach. This novel method will add significance and be beneficial for a wide range of aspects in the construction sector, contributing to the theoretical and practical domain.",21245087,32,44,,NUS - Xu
10.1061/jmenea.meeng-5366,A Decentralized and Automated Contracting System Using a Blockchain-Enabled Network of Stakeholders in Construction Megaprojects,"Purva Gupta, Kumar Neeraj Jha",Journal of Management in Engineering,2023,"With recent advances in information and communication technologies, trust and collaboration have become imperative in the construction industry. The increasing exchange of digital information and assets without much regard to contractual requirements has resulted in various data corruption, privacy, and security issues escalating to claims and disputes. Hence, there is a need to institute reforms in the existing contracting system to achieve a more efficient, collaborative, and transparent system. However, little research has investigated the digitalization of the contracting process, which continues to be traditional. This study is one of the first to develop a digital and automated contract management system leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts. Design science research methodology was adopted for the research work. The proposed system aims to achieve the following: (1) a decentralized permissioned network of stakeholders with well-defined roles and approval workflow, (2) automated contract execution based on predefined conditions using smart contracts, and (3) transaction history integrity with time stamps via a blockchain-based secured data structure. To exemplify these points, a use case is presented for implementing blockchain-based contract management in a construction megaproject. A conceptual model was developed illustrating the decentralized network of the key project stakeholders based in a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain environment. The roles and access controls of the stakeholders within the network are defined using the responsibility assignment [responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) matrix]. A computable and automated smart contract clause is formulated for the price variation clause used in construction contracts. A prototype of the proposed system was developed and demonstrated to industry experts for evaluation and validation. Positive feedback from the experts concerning the system characteristics and user-friendliness of the prototype showed that it possesses the potential to improve trust and transparency in the existing system. Whereas the decentralized stakeholder network would add trust and accountability to the system, the underlying blockchain data structure would enhance security and traceability by providing an immutable and real-time record of the transactions. The study provides a workable solution that serves as a valuable reference for future research in the field of contract management across multiple sectors. Although the system is shown to be applicable and feasible in this study, it may not be economically viable. It could be optimized in the future through cost–benefit analysis for different projects.",262691225,32,35,,NUS - Xu

Visionary construction stakeholders, including governments, practitioners, and academia, all have been actively devising strategies to deal with the crisis caused by the pandemic. Despite the rich contributions by academia, an in-depth review of their research works to understand how the pandemic has been handled to position the construction industry for post-pandemic actions and future pandemics is hitherto lacking. Hence, an up-to-date literature review is conducted in this study to better understand this terra incognita. It does so by adopting a six-step thematic analysis of 159 empirical peer-reviewed research articles in relation to COVID-19 on construction. The review discovered a growing research interest from different countries from 2020 to 2022. The existing studies can be put under four major topics, namely the COVID-19 impacts, challenges and opportunities, responding strategies, and post-COVID-19 interventions. A framework consisting of four categories of responding strategies, namely vaccination, personal responsibility of workers, government-instructional practices, and organisation-based approaches, is proposed through the lens of the socio-technical system theory to handle the pandemic crisis in construction. Limitations of the existing studies were further identified. Four pertinent research directions were finally proposed: building upon and testing the proposed COVID-19 response framework, adoption of more advanced innovative strategies to increase productivity amid pandemics and survive the risk of future pandemics, beyond the technological response to COVID-19 in construction, and post-pandemic view of the construction industry.

Nevertheless, an extensive collection of guidelines for using sustainable design principles in the construction of a railway station can provide several advantages. The goal is to review design visions for railway stations in Thailand, as reflected in student theses and government proposals, from 1983 to 2022 for sustainable design aspects in tropical climates. We perform an analysis of architectural design aspects including service areas, shape, entrances, roofing, style, and development in order to uncover design trends and possible areas that may be enhanced. Station designs are mostly characterized by curved and gable roofs, with 3D curved buildings being the next most common feature. High speed rail (HSR) stations stress local cultural elements in their major entrances while also improving passenger flow. Public buildings frequently employ curved or gabled porticos to achieve a majestic look. Although university theses place a high importance on conceptual design and functionality, it is essential to also consider cost-effectiveness. Key design considerations for future railway stations are transparency, connection, efficient mobility, and cost–time efficiency. The research uncovers deficiencies in user-centered design for thermal comfort and inclusiveness (design-for-all) in Thailand’s tropical environment.

Applying circular economy (CE) principles in the building construction industry would considerably reduce these values. However, uptake by the industry is relatively slow, which is largely attributed to sectoral barriers, including limitations in knowledge and experience. This review paper aims to assess and contribute to diminishing these obstacles by offering a comprehensive review of circular material usage principles and strategies within the construction sector. Opportunities and facilitators of change are also presented, including innovations and emerging technologies in recycling, digitization, robotic systems, novel materials, and processing. Finally, four case studies demonstrate the application of circular theory via a novel block system, recycled aggregate, modular kitchen reuse, and an energy efficiency retrofit. The conclusions show that future efforts should prioritize the development of strong regulatory frameworks, awareness initiatives, and international cooperation. In this regard, the integration of technological advancements, such as AI, robotics, and blockchain, is essential for optimizing waste management efficiency.

Wong",Buildings,2023,"Construction is a major source of carbon emissions. Moreover, it faces various other sustainability challenges, such as construction waste, construction noise, vehicular traffic near construction sites, dust and other air and water pollutants, and safety and well-being of construction workers. Poorly designed and constructed buildings will continue to affect the well-being of their occupants and overall energy efficiency throughout the building lifecycle. Hence, accelerating the transformation of the construction industry towards smart construction or Construction 4.0 is an important topic. The ways that technology can help to achieve smart construction, especially with the adoption of construction methods with increasing construction modularity, should be further explored. Focusing on modular integrated construction (MiC), this paper examines the following questions: (1) How has technology been applied to support MiC development and smart construction in Hong Kong? (2) What are the lessons learned? A case study approach of a building information model (BIM)-enabled multifunctional blockchain-based digital platform is adopted to allow us to systematically consider (1) the main objectives and scope, (2) the stakeholders involved, (3) the key outcomes and processes, (4) the applications of blockchain technology, and (5) the integration with other digital software and management platforms in practice. Drawing upon the experience, we propose a generic four-stage approach in understanding and facilitating the adoption of relevant technology towards smart construction. At Stage One, the technologies of BIM, RFID, and blockchain are applied to support the core elements of MiC production: just-in-time transportation and on-site installation. At Stage Two, the digital platform is extended to serve as an interface for third parties, notably government; monitoring, authentication, and certifications for information sharing; visualization; and real-time monitoring and updating of MiC projects. At Stage Three, the system focuses on people in the construction process, aiming to enhance the safety and well-being of workers and drivers throughout the construction process. Different Internet-of-Thing devices and sensors, construction robotics, closed-circuit television, dashboards, and cloud-based monitoring are deployed.

Over the past 20 years, China, one of the world’s largest producers of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), has made great efforts to improve e-waste management along with the massive generation of e-waste. In 2012, China implemented a unique EPR-based e-waste fund policy. However, the fund policy is unsustainable due to the challenges of non-closed resource use, informal recycling, and fund imbalance. Beginning with an overview of these challenges, this paper focuses on redesigning the fund policy from a closed-loop lifecycle perspective in order to maintain a balanced development of the resource use loop and the fund system in China’s ten-year plan. In doing so, two EPR instruments, recycling content standards and consumer-oriented deposits, are added to the current fund policy. Subsequently, three extension scenarios alternately changed a critical parameter of the model to test the impact on sustainable capabilities.

Besides, Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis is performed to study the corrosion morphology. Additionally, a Vickers microhardness tester was used for microhardness analysis. The results revealed that an increase in salinity from 33.18 to 61.10 ppt can reduce the corrosion rate by 28%. In contrast, variations in seawater pH have a significant effect on corrosion rate, with a pH decrease from 8.50 to 7 causing a 42.54% increase in corrosion rate. However, the temperature of seawater was found to be the most prominent parameter, resulting in a 76.13% increase in corrosion rate and a 10.99% reduction in the microhardness of offshore pipelines. Moreover, the response surface methodology (RSM) modelling is used to determine the optimal seawater parameters for carbon steel pipes.

Seventy-two articles were systematically selected, considering the PRISMA procedure, and were thoroughly analyzed based on BCT, methodologies, industrial sectors, geographical, and sustainability context. According to our findings, there is a significant lack of empirical and quantitative methodologies in the literature. The majority of studies did not take specific industries into account. Furthermore, the articles focusing on the sustainability context are few, particularly regarding social and environmental issues. In addition, most of the reviewed papers did not consider the geographical context. The results indicate that the deployment of BCT in several sectors is not uniform, and this utilization is reliant on their services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the concentration of research on the impacts of the BCT on SCM differs according to the conditions of various countries in terms of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also show that there is a direct relationship between the deployment of BCT and sustainability factors, such as economic and waste issues, under the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. Finally, this study offers research opportunities and agendas to help academics and other stakeholders to gain a better knowledge of the present literature, recognize aspects that necessitate more exploration, and drive prospective studies.",73255290,29,121,,NUS - Xu
10.1080/09613218.2021.1961574,Exploring the challenges of implementing design for excellence in industrialized construction projects in China,"I. Y. Wuni, Zezhou Wu, G. Shen",Building Research & Information,2021,"ABSTRACT It is recognized that design for excellence (DfX) methods could deliver significant performance improvements in industrialized construction (IC) projects. However, DfX methods in IC projects in China have been stifled, and existing solutions have failed to deliver expected outcomes. This study investigated the significance of thirty-one challenges of implementing DfX methods in IC projects in China using a questionnaire survey of domain practitioners and academics. Statistical analysis showed that all the challenges were perceived as significant. The top five significant challenges are linked to limited systematic rules, required additional commitment, code compliance complexities, higher design costs, and requirements for continuous design performance evaluation. The study established four principal constraints: limited knowledge and organizational readiness, unsupportive entrenched industry practices, increased organizational financial burden, and deficits in bespoke technical requirements. Therefore, the study offers a fresh insight into the challenges of implementing DfX methods in IC projects in China. It provides supporting evidence for developing countermeasures to improve the wider implementation of DfX in IC projects. The investigated challenges contribute to the theoretical checklist of constraints to implementing DfX methods in IC projects and may form a useful basis for future research.",209479899,29,41,,NUS - Xu

However, an up-to-date intellectual landscape to understand and identify the major opportunities of digital twins for smart buildings is still not enough. This study, therefore, performs an up-to-date comprehensive literature review to identify the major opportunities of digital twins for smart buildings. Design/methodology/approach Scientometric and content analysis are utilised to comprehensively evaluate the intellectual landscape of the general knowledge of digital twins for smart buildings. Findings The study uncovered 24 opportunities that were further categorised into four major opportunities: efficient building performance (smart “building” environment), efficient building process (smart construction site environment), information efficiency and effective user interactions. The study further identified the limitations of the existing studies and made recommendations for future research in the methodology adopted and the research domain. Five research domains were considered for future research, namely “real-time data acquisition, processing and storage”, “security and privacy issues”, “standardised and domain modelling”, “collaboration between the building industry and the digital twin developers” and “skilled workforce to enable a seamless transition from theory to practice”. Practical implications All stakeholders, including practitioners, policymakers and researchers in the field of “architecture, engineering, construction and operations” (AECO), may benefit from the findings of this study by gaining an in-depth understanding of the opportunities of digital twins and their implementation in smart buildings in the AECO industry. The limitations and the possible research directions may serve as guidelines for streamlining the practical adoption and implementation of digital twins for smart buildings. Originality/value This study adopted scientometric and content analysis to comprehensively assess the intellectual landscape of relevant literature and identify four major opportunities of digital twins for smart building, to which scholars have given limited attention.

Mills, E. Papadonikolaki, Baofeng Li, Jing Huang",Architectural Engineering and Design Management,2022,"ABSTRACT This study aims to use modularity to impact various facets of Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) and explore the relationship between product modularity, process modularity, and DfMA within the context of Offsite Construction (OSC). The study fills this gap through an exploratory single case study by identifying perceptual measures of these three concepts. The study shows the alignment between multi-dimensionality of modularity, such as product modularity and process modularity, enhances the capability of DfMA. From a modularity perspective, the reconfiguration of abstraction, information hiding, and interface is an essential strategy to change the traditional design process. This reconfiguration is to adapt to the new scenarios brought by OSC and digital fabrication technologies and the new design tasks associated with these scenarios. This study has theoretical implications for the modular approach to DfMA and practical implications for those who expect digital fabrication techniques in offsite construction.",230711296,28,70,,NUS - Xu

Amor",Urban Science,2021,"The building sector is responsible for extensive resource consumption and waste generation, resulting in high pressure on the environment. A way to potentially mitigate this is by including environmental considerations during building design through the concept known as eco-design. Despite the multiple available approaches of eco-design, the latter is not easily achieved in the building sector. The objective of this paper is to identify and discuss what barriers are currently hindering the implementation of eco-design in the building sector and by which measures building designers can include environmental considerations in their design process. Through a systematic literature review, several barriers to implementation were identified, the main ones being lack of suitable legislation, lack of knowledge amongst building designers, and lack of suitable tools for designers to use. Furthermore, two specific tools were identified that allow the inclusion of environmental consideration in building design, along with nine design strategies providing qualitative guidance on how to potentially minimize energy and material consumption, as well as waste generation. This paper contributes a holistic overview of the major barriers to and existing tools and method for the eco-design of buildings, and provides guidance for both future research and practice.",22241234,28,132,,NUS - Xu

Many technologies, such as the Building Information Model (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), etc., are concerned with virtual representation and manipulation of the physical site. However, a holistic view of the off-site construction processes is lacking in the exploration of the technological advances, resulting in inconsistency when applying these advances in practice. The concept of Digital Twin is useful for addressing this challenge. Digital Twin is a philosophy and a collection of technologies aimed toward seamless physical and virtual connections. Therefore, a holistic Off-site Construction Digital Twin model is necessary for any research concerning this topic, and an assessment framework is useful in helping off-site construction industry companies in approaching systematic Digital Twin. This research first proposes a model for Off-site Construction Digital Twin. To quantify this model, an assessment tool named Off-site Construction Digital Twin Maturity Level is proposed. The validation and evaluation of this assessment framework are conducted through a case study with ACQBuilt, an off-site construction company in Edmonton, Canada. The resulting assessment framework contributes to the body of knowledge in two ways: Firstly, it sets the foundation for an Off-site Construction Digital Twin, which is anticipated to significantly reduce waste and to improve efficiency. Secondly, it enables easier technology application in practice by offering a holistic Digital Twin framework.",252670804,28,42,,NUS - Xu

Differentiated reduction management policy is the key to C&DW reduction management. Based on the calculation of C&DW generation, this paper studies the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics, heterogeneity of C&DW with economic growth, and driving factors of C&DW generation in 30 provinces from 2007 to 2018 by using the methods of standard deviation ellipse model, environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and geographic detector. The results show that the C&DW generation in China shows an increasing trend, “low in the west, and high in the East” and “high in the South and low in the north,” with significant regional differences. The temporal and spatial distribution of C&DW generation shows a “northeast southwest” trend, and this pattern has a trend of changing to “due north - due south”; C&DW generation increases with the economic growth, and the proportion of “inverted N” provinces is large, which is in the stage of continuous increase in the C&DW generation; The economic output effect of construction industry is the most important factor affecting the spatial distribution of C&DW generation. The impact of C&DW generation in each province has shifted from the single core driving effect of economy to the common guidance of economy and environmental protection. The interaction of different factors has a greater impact on the spatial distribution of C&DW generation than that of each factor alone.",251057869,28,87,,NUS - Xu

Marini",Sustainability,2022,"The decarbonization of the construction sector, which is one of the most impactful sectors worldwide, requires a significant paradigm shift from a linear economy to a circular, future-proofed and sustainable economy. In this transition, the role of designers and structural engineers becomes pivotal, and new design objectives and principles inspired by Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) should be defined and included from the early stages of the design process to allow for a truly sustainable renovation of the built environment. In this paper, an overview of LCT-based objectives and principles is provided, critically analyzing the current state of the art of sustainability and circularity in the construction sector. The effectiveness of applying such design principles from the early stages of the design of retrofit interventions is then demonstrated with reference to a case study building. Four seismic retrofit alternatives made of timber, steel and concrete, conceived according to either LCT principles or traditional, were designed and compared to a demolition and reconstruction scenario on the basis of five common environmental impact indicators. The indicators were calculated adopting simplified LCA analyses based on Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), considering the product and End of Life stages of the building. The results of the comparative analyses confirm that LCT-based retrofit solutions are less impactful than both the traditional seismic retrofit interventions and the demolition and reconstruction scenario.",235787452,28,58,,NUS - Xu

We adopted the social network analysis to explore SCV in prefabricated building projects (PBPs) from multiple perspectives. A two-mode network was constructed to quantitatively analyze the impact of stakeholders on SCV factors. A one-mode network was also built to explore the interrelationships between SCV factors. Digital technologies (DTs) were then investigated to understand whether and how they contribute to SCV abatement in PBPs. Results show that stakeholders have different degrees of influence on different categories of SCV factors. The main contractor, assembly subcontractor, and manufacturer are the critical stakeholders generating SCV with significant potential for cooperation in reducing SCV in PBPs. Critical SCV factors, links, and the associated influencing paths are analyzed to gain in-depth insights into SCV. Project organizational vulnerabilities account for the largest proportion of critical nodes. The combination of building information modeling, Internet of things, augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence can effectively alleviate SCV in PBPs.

Although off-site construction (OSC) is a method of widely acknowledged efficiency, its current uptake in India is very low, and the factors hindering its wider adaptation have not been comprehensively researched. This paper employs interviews with experts, a questionnaire survey and the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique to achieve the following objectives: first, to reveal which factors are perceived as top barriers for OSC implementation in India; second, to develop a hierarchical model presenting the causality between these factors; and third, to propose the initiatives required for barriers with high impact on other barriers to be most efficiently tackled. The survey findings show that the barriers perceived as most important from the professionals’ point of view are design inflexibility, difficulties in storage and transportation, supply chain weaknesses, initial capital requirements and lack of skills. The ISM reveals, though, that the underlying causes for these barriers lie with factors such as public procurement regulations and the fragmentation of the sector.
