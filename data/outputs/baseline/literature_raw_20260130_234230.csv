These activities include the identification and analysis of emerging risks, the enhancement of risk identification methodologies, and the communication of identified risks. At first stage, the focus was on the identification and prioritisation of data sources of historical food fraud cases. This phase involved rigorous criteria for data selection to ensure accuracy and relevance. Subsequently, a labelled dataset was developed through systematic data categorisation and annotation, essential for training the computational model to detect patterns of potential safety risks in food fraud incidents. The core of the project involved the creation of the Computational Model (CM) using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms. Six state‐of‐the‐art NLP models (BERT, XLNet, GPT‐3, ELECTRA, T5, and ELMo) were identified, trained and tested on the labelled dataset, with XLNet achieving an F1‐Score of 95% and a ROC/AUC Score of 98%. An iterative refinement phase followed, involving feedback from the FFRAUD‐ER Network and stakeholders to enhance the model's reliability. Finally, the model's application in real‐world scenarios was explored, demonstrating its utility in aiding EFSA and other Emerging Risk Identification networks to detect emerging food safety risks. The results indicate that the computational model can successfully determine whether a food fraud instance poses a food safety risk. Statistical and analytical techniques applied alongside the CM on newly acquired data of food fraud incidents have shown potential, although their efficiency and effectiveness will primarily depend on the quality and quantity of future data.",284570844,0,26,,ESG List

Zadpoor",arXiv.org,2025,"Living biological tissue is a complex system, constantly growing and changing in response to external and internal stimuli. These processes lead to remarkable and intricate changes in shape. Modeling and understanding both natural and pathological (or abnormal) changes in the shape of anatomical structures is highly relevant, with applications in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic healthcare. Nevertheless, modeling the longitudinal shape change of biological tissue is a non-trivial task due to its inherent nonlinear nature. In this review, we highlight several existing methodologies and tools for modeling longitudinal shape change (i.e., spatiotemporal shape modeling). These methods range from diffeomorphic metric mapping to deep-learning based approaches (e.g., autoencoders, generative networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.). We discuss the synergistic combinations of existing technologies and potential directions for future research, underscoring key deficiencies in the current research landscape.",285779936,0,201,,ESG List
10.3390/risks13040074,Fuzzy Non-Payment Risk Management Rooted in Optimized Household Consumption Units,"Gregorio Izquierdo Llanes, Antonio M. Salcedo",Risks,2025,"Traditionally, business risk management models have not taken into consideration household composition for the purposes of credit granting or project financing in order to manage the risk of default. In this research, an improvement in the risk management model was obtained by introducing household composition as a new exogenous variable. With the application of generalized reduced gradient nonlinear optimization modeling, improved consumption units are determined according to the different types of household size and the age of their members. Estimated household economies of scale show a consistent pattern even in the year 2020, corresponding with the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, an adjusted estimation of the household equivalized disposable income is obtained. Based on this more accurate equivalized income estimation, acceptable debt levels can be determined. The estimation of probabilities of default allows the household risk of default to be managed. In this way, a novel model is proposed by incorporating household composition into credit risk evaluation using fuzzy clustering and optimization techniques. Companies can assess the expected loss of a credit exposure through a model that can help them in the process of making evidence-informed decisions.",286112392,0,50,,ESG List

Liu, Cheng Zhang, Wenjuan Gu, Tingqiang Yao, Jihong Shen, Dan Tang",International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology,2025,"ABSTRACT Accurate segmentation of the female pelvic structures is crucial for diagnosing and treating female pelvic disorders. However, the complex and variable shapes of the pelvic organs, along with their blurred boundary features, present significant challenges. To address the aforementioned issues, HDFMFP‐Net, a multi‐organ segmentation network for female pelvic MR images, is constructed based on hierarchical decoupled fusion and multi‐scale feature processing. Firstly, to address the problem of the complex and variable shapes of the pelvic organs, a hierarchical decoupled fusion module is constructed as a fundamental unit. This module is used to build a lightweight encoder‐decoder structure, which reduces the accumulation of estimated bias while effectively extracting the complex boundary features of pelvic organs through multi‐scale feature learning and cross‐layer information interaction. Secondly, to address the challenge posed by the blurred boundary features of pelvic organs, a multi‐scale feature processing module is integrated into the skip connections. This module captures features at multiple scales from both local and global perspectives, enhancing the network's ability to represent the fuzzy boundary features of organs. Finally, the algorithm was evaluated on the female pelvic dataset to segment the bladder, uterus, and rectum in female pelvic images, and the mIoU, mDice, and mPA of HDFMFP‐Net reached 92.98%, 96.3%, and 96.24%, respectively, with a model size of only 2.80 M.

The purpose of this study is to develop a scale that measures students’ attitudes towards AI-based scoring systems in education and to test the validity and reliability of this scale. In the study, a literature review was conducted and expert opinion was consulted to develop the scale items. The first form of the scale was administered to 416 participants. The construct validity of the scale was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and rotation procedures. As a result of these procedures, a structure consisting of 12 items and two main factors (AI-SAS positive attitude and AI-SAS negative attitude) was determined. In the next step, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out on the data obtained from 441 participants. The results showed that the scale has robust construct validity. To test concurrent validity, comparisons with the General Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) and the AI Anxiety Scale (AI Anxiety) revealed significant relationships between the AI-SAS and these scales. In addition, measurement invariance was tested to ensure that the scale would measure consistently across different demographic groups. The results showed that the AI-SAS scale has a similar factor structure in different groups according to demographic variables such as gender, type of school, use of artificial intelligence in daily life, and can therefore be used in different subgroups.

Traditional forecasting models often rely on metrics like mean squared error (MSE), which fail to adequately address the issue of timely event detection. Predictions that follow actual events—particularly in scenarios such as financial risk—reduce the practical relevance of forecasting, where early and accurate warnings are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to mitigate prediction delays, especially in the context of time series forecasting for financial risk. Specifically, we introduce a Continuous Peephole LSTM framework, integrated with a continuous Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) approach, to capture intricate temporal dependencies. Instead of relying solely on MSE, we incorporate new evaluation metrics, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Temporal Distortion Index (TDI), to quantitatively analyze the timeliness of the model’s predictions. These metrics are integrated into the training process, enabling us to evaluate performance from multiple perspectives, including both predictive accuracy and dynamic trend capture. Empirical results across five financial time series datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models. On average, it achieves improvements of 14% in MSE, 6.52% in DTW, and 14.63% in TDI. These results highlight the effectiveness of our model in improving both the accuracy of the prediction and the timeliness of detecting key events in the prediction of financial risks.

Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.",293475436,0,60,,ESG List

The introduction of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) in 2021 has made progress toward enhancing transparency, though its reach remains limited. Currently, the BRSR applies only to the top 1,000 companies, lacks robust assurance measures, and suffers from fragmented oversight, resulting in critical gaps in credibility, comparability, and investor confidence. This paper evaluates India’s framework against the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Guidance in South Africa. Drawing on policy-mix theory and the multi-level perspective, the analysis highlights how the CSRD benefits from statutory assurance and integrated legislation. In contrast, the JSE illustrates the inherent weaknesses of voluntary alignment without enforcement. The findings indicate that BRSR is feasible but weak in credibility and alignment, leaving India vulnerable to reputational and investment risks. Three reform pathways are assessed: maintaining the status quo, adopting a CSRD-style framework, or enhancing BRSR with phased mandatory assurance.

While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis.

In this study, we aim to automatically process and score customer-related news by employing natural language processing and machine learning–based methods for automated sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. The system comprises the stages of collecting news from RSS sources, performing named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis with Turkish BERT-based models, and then applying the scoring model. The developed framework enables the classification of news items as positive, negative, or neutral and allows these scores to be integrated into credit evaluation processes. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model reliably identifies and classifies the sentiment of customer-related news items in a manner consistent with business experts’ assessments.

Hewahi, Youssef Harrath",Computers,2025,"Feature selection is pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of credit scoring predictions, where misclassifications are critical because they can result in financial losses for lenders and exclusion of eligible borrowers. While traditional feature selection methods can improve accuracy and class separation, they often struggle to maintain consistent performance aligned with institutional preferences across datasets of varying size and imbalance. This study introduces a FastTree-Guided Genetic Algorithm (FT-GA) that combines gradient-boosted learning with evolutionary optimization to prioritize class separability and minimize false-risk exposure. In contrast to traditional approaches, FT-GA provides fine-grained search guidance by acknowledging that false positives and false negatives carry disproportionate consequences in high-stakes lending contexts. By embedding domain-specific weighting into its fitness function, FT-GA favors separability over raw accuracy, reflecting practical risk sensitivity in real credit decision settings. Experimental results show that FT-GA achieved similar or higher AUC values ranging from 76% to 92% while reducing the average feature set by 21% when compared with the strongest baseline techniques. It also demonstrated strong performance on small to moderately imbalanced datasets and more resilience on highly imbalanced ones.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of different time series forecasting models applied to real-world data from multiple repositories, comparing local (one model per project) and global (a single model trained across multiple projects) approaches. We considered classical models (Naive, Linear Regression, Random Forest) and neural networks (MLP, LSTM, GRU), with global extensions including Random Forest and LSTM with project embeddings. The results highlight that, at the local level, Random Forest achieves lower errors and better classification metrics than deep learning models in several cases. However, global models show greater robustness and generalizability: in particular, the global Random Forest significantly reduces the mean error and maintains high performance in terms of accuracy and F1 score, while the global LSTM captures temporal dependencies and provides additional insights into cross-project dynamics. The explainable AI techniques adopted (permutation importance, saliency maps, and embedding analysis) allow us to interpret the main drivers of forecasts, confirming the role of process variables and temporal characteristics.

We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default.

Using a systematic–bibliometric approach, we quantitatively analyzed a total of 129 documents, which collectively were cited 4276 times (2017–2024). Following performance analysis, we conducted a rigorous systematic literature review, critically evaluating each document to identify key research methods, geographic focus, theories, and frameworks. We then performed citation network and co‐citation analyses to uncover the intellectual foundations of the field. We also employed bibliographic coupling to identify emerging research streams, while thematic evaluation provided insights into the evolution of research areas over time, highlighting both the most and least explored themes. Finally, our complementary systematic–bibliometric analyses enabled us to derive an integrated framework outlining key antecedents, mediators, moderators, and outcomes. This in turn allows us to develop a structured conclusion for each of the six identified research clusters, which will guide future research directions in AI and ESG. We also discuss practical and theoretical implications, offering valuable insights for scholars and practitioners in the field.",294870760,0,126,,ESG List
10.3390/su172411128,From News to Knowledge: Leveraging AI and Knowledge Graphs for Real-Time ESG Insights,"Omar Mohmmed Hassan Nassar, Fahimeh Jafari, Chanchal Jain",Sustainability,2025,"Traditional Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assessments rely heavily on corporate disclosures and third-party ratings, which are often delayed, inconsistent, and prone to bias. These limitations leave stakeholders without timely visibility into rapidly evolving ESG events. These assessment frameworks also fail to capture the dynamic nature of ESG issues reflected in public news media. This research addresses these limitations by proposing and implementing an automated framework utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Graphs (KG), to analyse ESG news data for companies listed on major stock indices. The methodology involves several stages: collecting a registry of target companies; retrieving relevant news articles; applying Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and ESG domain classification; and constructing a linked property knowledge graph to structure the extracted information semantically. The framework culminates in an interactive dashboard for visualising and querying the resulting graph database. The resulting knowledge graph supports comparative inferential analytics across indices and sectors, uncovering divergent ESG sentiment profiles and thematic priorities that traditional reports overlook. The analysis also reveals comparative insights into sentiment trends and ESG focus areas across different exchanges and sectors, offering perspectives often missing from traditional methods. Findings indicate differing ESG sentiment profiles and thematic focuses between the UK (FTSE) and Australian (ASX) indices within the analysed dataset. This study confirms AI/KG’s potential for a modular, dynamic, and semantically rich ESG intelligence approach, transforming unstructured news into interconnected insights. Limitations and areas for future work, including model refinement and integration of financial data, are also discussed. This proposed framework augments traditional ESG evaluations with automated, scalable, and context-rich analysis.",294937804,0,8,,ESG List

This paper presents an application-oriented view of RFF technology, from its technical foundation to extraction techniques (signal parts, extraction processes, and application conditions), and explores potential use cases. We highlight promising scenarios where RFF can enhance the security and functionality of wireless systems with various sensing applications. Importantly, we discuss the ethical implications of RFF, which can be used to violate individual privacy, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment.

A standardized auditing prompt was applied across all tools to generate comparable assessments of visual greenwashing. Contrary to theoretical expectations and all four hypotheses, the models did not demonstrate negative correlations between performance and AI-detected greenwashing; instead, high-performing firms frequently received higher greenwashing scores. Dimensional analyses showed inconsistent and often contradictory evaluations across Environmental, Social, and Governance pillars, while inter-tool reliability proved extremely low (Krippendorff’s α ≈ 0). These findings indicate that current multimodal AI systems conflate communication sophistication with deceptive intent and lack sufficient contextual understanding for ESG assurance.

KIM",Sensors,2025,"This study introduces the Hybrid Integrated Prediction-Error Reconstruction-based Anomaly Detection (HIPER-CHAD) model, which addresses the challenge of reliably detecting subtle anomalies in noisy multivariate indoor environmental time-series data. The main objective is to separate temporal modeling of normal behavior from probabilistic modeling of prediction uncertainty, ensuring that the anomaly score becomes robust to stochastic fluctuations while remaining sensitive to truly abnormal events. The HIPER-CHAD architecture first employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast the next time step’s sensor readings, subsequently forming a residual error vector that captures deviations from the expected temporal pattern. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is then trained on these residual vectors rather than on the raw sensor data to learn the distribution of normal prediction errors and quantify their probabilistic unicity. The final anomaly score integrates the VAE’s reconstruction error with its Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, yielding a statistically grounded measure that jointly reflects the magnitude and distributional abnormality of the residual. The proposed model is evaluated on a real-world multivariate indoor environmental dataset and compared against eight traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines using a synthetic ground truth generated by a 99th percentile-based criterion. HIPER-CHAD achieves an F1-score of 0.8571, outperforming the next best model, the LSTM Autoencoder (F1 = 0.8095), while maintaining perfect recall. Furthermore, a time-step sensitivity analysis demonstrates that a 20-step window yields an optimal F1-score of 0.884, indicating that the proposed residual-based hybrid design provides a reliable and accurate framework for anomaly detection in complex multivariate time-series data.",296507891,0,40,,ESG List

We propose a novel hybrid semi‐supervised federated domain adaptation architecture for fault detection in DH. We use a one‐class variational autoencoder (VAE) to leverage heterogeneous sensor streams from 434 distributed substations. First, we perform cross‐network unsupervised pre‐training on multi‐sourced data from two independent real‐world DH networks, fusing their return temperature dynamics into a robust shared manifold. Second, we leverage maintenance metadata to selectively allow verified‐normal clients for per‐round fine‐tuning of the model. Third, we drastically reduce uplink costs by compressing each client's weight delta using 10% top‐ k sparsification and demonstrate that our pipeline enables robust few‐shot finetuning with 20% of the normal operational data while retaining high detection performance. By strategically training, our method achieves F 1 and G‐mean scores of up to 97% and an AUC ≥ 99% on real‐world DH data.

Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz.

While traditional ESG ratings had been widely used in responsible investment strategies, they often suffered from data inconsistency, subjectivity and limited coverage of unstructured sustainability information. AI-based ESG systems were increasingly applied to extract deeper sustainability signals from corporate disclosures, reports and external data sources. Using portfolio-level analysis, this study compared the financial outcomes of portfolios constructed using AI-driven ESG indicators with those based on conventional ESG ratings. The results showed that AI-enhanced high-ESG portfolios achieved higher mean returns and superior Sharpe ratios than both AI-based low-ESG portfolios and traditionally rated ESG portfolios. In addition, AI-driven high-ESG portfolios demonstrated lower downside-risk exposure and smaller maximum drawdowns during market stress, indicating stronger resilience. Regression analysis further revealed that AI-derived ESG scores were more strongly associated with excess returns than traditional ESG metrics. These findings suggested that AI improved the informational efficiency of ESG assessment by capturing more accurate, forward-looking sustainability risks and opportunities. The study concluded that AI-driven ESG analytics strengthened the financial relevance of sustainability integration and supported better-informed investment decision-making. The results carried important implications for investors, regulators and corporations seeking to align AI deployment with high-integrity sustainable finance practices, while also highlighting the need for ethical and transparent AI governance in financial markets.

10.3390/su18010415,Executives’ Tone Management and Corporate Financial Sustainability: A Corporate Governance Perspective,"Dongdong Wu, Yubing Wang, Shanyue Jin",Sustainability,2026,"This study uses Chinese A-share listed companies from 2014 to 2023 as the research sample (comprising a total of 18,053 firm-year observations) and explores the impact of executive tone manipulation on corporate sustainable growth capability from the perspective of corporate governance. Benchmark fixed-effects regression results indicate that the regression coefficient of tone manipulation on the sustainable growth rate is −0.141 (p &lt; 0.01). Corporate financial sustainability is measured by the sustainable growth rate, an indicator reflecting a firm’s endogenous growth capacity while maintaining existing financial policies and operational efficiency. This differs distinctly from “broad-based sustainability” measured by ESG metrics. Therefore, this study focuses on sustainability in the financial dimension and further analyzes the moderating effects of corporate social responsibility information disclosure quality, institutional investor ownership ratio, and board independence. The findings reveal that executive tone manipulation significantly undermines corporate financial sustainability, while sound governance mechanisms can effectively mitigate this adverse impact. This research enriches the theoretical framework of financial sustainability studies from the perspectives of linguistic information and behavioral governance and provides policy implications for information disclosure regulation and governance optimization.",296748832,0,99,,ESG List

10.3390/ijfs14010005,The Impact of Philanthropic Donations on Corporate Future Stock Returns Under the Sustainable Development Philosophy—From the Perspective of ESG Rating Constraints,"Y Chen, Yawen Wang, Cunjing Liu",International Journal of Financial Studies,2026,"Fulfilling social responsibilities within the ESG framework has gradually become a core competitive advantage for sustainable corporate development that also serves to enhance future returns. Charitable donations constitute a crucial method through which corporations fulfill social responsibilities and represent a primary indicator in ESG ratings, ratings that in turn have an impact on future stock market returns. This study, based on data from listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2018 to 2022, employed a fixed effects model to analyze the influence of charitable donations on future returns under ESG rating constraints. The research reveals that ESG rating constraints can reduce speculative charitable donations and help to optimize the peak value of a company’s future returns. After a series of robustness tests, including using the one-period lagged explanatory variable, changing the measurement method of the explained variable, replacing the ESG with the assignment method for value determination, and considering the impact of outliers, the conclusion still holds. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that in state-owned enterprises, companies in a recessionary phase, and industries with lower levels of competition, a decelerating effect of ESG ratings on the impact of charitable donations on future returns dominates. Conversely, for mature companies, ESG ratings accelerate the positive effect of charitable donations on future returns. This paper contributes to the ESG economic consequences literature by offering empirical evidence on corporate social responsibility implementation under sustainability strategies.",296781298,0,10,,ESG List

This study introduces Polarized Amplitude Time Spiral Encoding (PATSE), a novel transformation that encodes amplitude and time into spiral-based polar representations, enabling richer visual features for deep learning. To address data scarcity and imbalance, audio augmentation techniques time stretching, time shifting, pitch scaling, and polarity inversion were applied, expanding the dataset from 457 to 6855 samples. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on PATSE images achieved notable improvements, with overall accuracy increasing from 80% before augmentation to 93% after augmentation. The model attained high performance on the dominant Hungry class (F1-score = 0.96) while also enhancing recognition of minority classes such as belly pain, burping, discomfort, and tired.

Since introducing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concept in 2004, sustainability has increasingly been integrated into corporate business models, particularly through adherence to principles of responsible investment, standardized reporting, and accounting practices. This study examines the impact of ESG factors on the financial performance of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), based on data from Morningstar, Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), and European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), analysing evidence from the reviewed literature. The primary objective is to assess the progress of green transition within the REIT sector and the influence of sustainability initiatives on returns and competitive positioning, with empirical analyses focusing on environmental sustainability (E) and its impact on European REITs' returns. The methodology employed includes comparative analysis, literature review, and OLS regression analysis. The results indicate a slowdown in ESG implementation progress worldwide, largely attributed to the substantial costs associated with compliance, including developing reporting capacity and sustainable initiatives. Despite observed capital outflows, the 2024 real estate assessment results show notable progress in key areas, including energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, water and waste management, and social engagement practices within REITs. The empirical analysis of large-cap European REITs aligns with existing research, showing progress towards reducing environmental impact in 2022-2024, positively influencing share prices. In terms of financial effects, the reviewed literature suggests that while the short-term financial impact of ESG measures varies, there is a general trend toward improved long-term performance. Although results across individual metrics remain inconclusive, findings indicate that complex sustainability strategies contribute to enhanced competitiveness and overall financial performance.

Sabry, Hosam Moubarak",Journal of risk and financial management,2026,"This study classifies corporate financial performance in countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, addressing the critical need for accurate and early identification of high-, moderate-, and low-performance companies. The selection of the MENA region was driven by its significant economic growth, diverse market structures, and increasing attractiveness for foreign investment, which makes accurate financial performance assessment important. Despite the growing interest in AI applications for corporate financial performance, a research gap still persists. Existing studies focus primarily on bankruptcy and financial distress prediction in developed countries, with rather limited studies on multi-class financial performance classification in the MENA region. This study addresses a significant gap in the corporate financial performance evaluation literature, which is the lack of a robust, comparative evaluation of advanced DL techniques against conventional ML methods for multi-class corporate financial performance prediction using high-dimensional data. This study employs a design science research (DSR) approach by developing an evaluation analytics artifact that integrates structured preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and comparative ML and DL modeling, following the relevance, design, and rigor cycles. By employing a design science research (DSR) methodology, the research used a dataset from the Compustat database, comprising 7971 firm-year observations from 2013 to 2024. A rigorous dimensionality reduction process, including pairwise correlation filtering, resulted in a final set of 15 key classification features. The study compared three machine learning techniques—random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), against one deep learning technique, deep neural networks (DNNs), for classifying the corporate financial performance of MENA-region companies. The models were trained to classify corporations into three performance classes (low, moderate, and high), using the earnings per share (EPS) as the target variable. The empirical findings indicate that all four machine learning algorithms achieved meaningful predictive performance in classifying EPS-based corporate performance. Among the benchmark models, the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers produced stable and competitive results, indicating strong generalization capabilities across firms and periods. XGBoost consistently outperformed the traditional machine learning models, delivering the highest overall classification accuracy and superior discriminatory power, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing nonlinear relationships and complex feature interactions. Similarly, the deep neural network further improved classification performance relative to the benchmark models and exhibited comparable results to XGBoost, especially in modeling high-dimensional data. This superior performance can substantially enhance earnings performance classification through early performance deterioration and improvement identification, allowing more proactive strategic and operational decisions.",297229454,0,80,,ESG List

Evaluators and investors utilize big data, encompassing structured, unstructured, internal, and external data types, for assessment purposes and to monitor firms’ ESG-based sustainable performance. Additionally, a combination of unstructured and structured big data is used to generate ESG-related sustainability reports. The ESG big data is sourced from financial databases, ESG research providers, media platforms, and technologies such as satellite imagery and IoT sensors through real-time data collection and processing. Likewise, to measure and evaluate big data sets, the abundant analytical techniques and tools, such as machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, etc., are available that are vital for decoding the multifaceted datasets for building ESG reports. The firms’ ESG impact with big data is assessed by evaluating their sustainability information on preserving ESG measures. Thus, big data-driven ESG investing offers influential tools for measuring sustainability. On the other hand, it also comes with substantial challenges such as data quality and reliability, data privacy and ethics, standardization, etc. Indeed, the future of big data in ESG investing is set to be driven by swift advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools.

10.1051/shsconf/202622701001,"From privatization to a governance predicament: A systematic review of jakarta’s water governance, business models, and sustainability",Ade Hendraputra,SHS Web of Conferences,2026,"Jakarta, one of the world’s fastest-sinking megacities, faces a multidimensional water crisis that poses an existential threat to its sustainability. This crisis stems from the historical legacy of a two-decade Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiated in 1998, which evolved from a privatization model into a complex predicament of environmental degradation and social injustice. This study employs a systematic literature review to synthesize the academic evidence, tracing the evolution of challenges and proposed solutions over time. The synthesis reveals a cascading failure best understood through an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) lens. Initial Governance failures, rooted in flawed contractual design, metastasized into severe Environmental crises (land subsidence) and a profound Social crisis of “water equity,” disproportionately burdening the urban poor. The review concludes that Jakarta’s water crisis is fundamentally a crisis of governance, not infrastructure or affordability. Therefore, the only viable path forward is a new sustainable business model for the public utility focused on re-establishing robust governance and rebuilding public trust, which is critical for achieving water security.",297330989,0,10,,ESG List

Using audited integrated annual reports, the analysis combines financial indicators (ROA, ROE, EBITDA margin) with sustainability metrics (CO2 emissions, renewable share, and green capital expenditure). The results show partial yet significant relationships. The renewable share is positively associated with asset profitability (ROA) for both firms, with a stronger effect for Galp (r = 0.49) than for EDP (r = 0.26). Carbon emissions exhibit a negative relationship with shareholder returns (ROE) in EDP (r = −0.32) but remain positively linked for Galp (r = 0.43), illustrating the persistence of short-term “brown profits.” Green capital expenditure has divergent effects, slightly reducing operating margins in EDP but improving efficiency in Galp. These findings highlight how transition timing and strategic orientation shape the financial outcomes of sustainability policies. Consistent with stakeholder theory and the concept of shared value, the study suggests that sustainability-oriented strategies enhance firms' resilience and long-term competitiveness. By integrating financial and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions, it contributes comparative firmlevel evidence from Portugal and underscores the emerging role of FinTech solutions in enhancing ESG transparency and the efficiency of sustainable finance mechanisms.",297388081,0,0,,ESG List

However, as these methods are increasingly being applied in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, the need of transparent and interpretable clustering outcomes has become a critical concern. This is not only necessary for gaining user trust but also for satisfying the growing ethical and regulatory demands in these fields. Ensuring that decisions derived from clustering algorithms can be clearly understood and justified is now a fundamental requirement. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured review of the current state of explainable clustering algorithms, identifying key criteria to distinguish between various methods. These insights can effectively assist researchers in making informed decisions about the most suitable explainable clustering methods for specific application contexts, while also promoting the development and adoption of clustering algorithms that are both efficient and transparent.

This study examines the financial performance of 34 European ESG ETFs linked to the MSCI Europe Index from 2015 to 2024, taking into account key events like the Paris Agreement, COVID-19, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. To assess ESG ETF performance, we apply the Sharpe (Sharpe, Management Science 9:277–293, 1963) index model and the Fama French (Fama and French, Journal of Financial Economics 116:1–22, 2015) five-factor model. Furthermore, we analyze how geopolitical crises, health crises, and the choice of ESG strategy are related to ETF performance. The results indicate that the ESG strategy itself shows only a limited relationship with alpha values, but is related with the sensitivity to market fluctuations. Moreover, we find that ESG ETFs tend to underperform their non-sustainable benchmarks during periods of geopolitical turmoil, accompanied by increased risk exposure, as observed during the Russia–Ukraine conflict.",297559593,0,0,,ESG List
(missing DOI),Effects of Real Earnings Management and ESG Disclosure on the Cost of Debt with Political Connections as a Moderating Variable: Evidence from Listed Firms in Indonesia,"Ramiz Firas, Antonius Ragil Kuncoro",DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),2026,"As a crucial financial metric, the cost of debt measures the economic burden that a firm bears when using loans to fund its operations. Using a regression model, this study examines how real earnings management, ESG disclosure, political connections, and several control variables affect the cost of debt within the context of non-financial firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the observation period from 2018 to 2021. The results reveal that real earnings management has a significant positive connection with the cost of debt, while ESG Disclosure does not have a significant negative relationship with the cost of debt. As a moderating variable, political connections have been shown to strengthen the positive relationship between real earnings management and the cost of debt. Similarly, political connections also strengthen the negative relationship between ESG Disclosure and the cost of debt. This study highlights the importance of using ethical and transparent financial practices and robust ESG disclosure in managing debt costs.

This study investigates a data-driven approach for absolute position prediction of a 2-DOF planar delta robot by learning time-series force signals generated during manipulability-driven free motion. Constant torques of opposite directions were applied to the robot without any position or trajectory control, allowing the mechanism to move naturally according to its configuration-dependent manipulability. Reaction forces measured at the end-effector and relative encoder variations were collected across a grid of workspace locations and used to construct a 12-channel time-series input. A hybrid deep learning architecture combining 1D convolutional layers and a bidirectional LSTM network was trained to regress the robot’s absolute X–Y position. Experimental results demonstrate that the predicted trajectories closely match the measured paths in the workspace, yielding overall RMSE values of 3.81 mm(X) and 2.94 mm(Y). Statistical evaluation using RMSE shows that approximately 83.73% of all test sequences achieve an error below 5 mm. The findings confirm that LSTM models can effectively learn posture-dependent dynamic behavior and force-manipulability relationships.",297791510,0,19,,ESG List

Traditional statistical and machine-learning models struggle with these multi-scale variations, and existing deep learning approaches often rely on fixed receptive fields or fail to extract adaptive periodic structures. This study introduces MA-CFAN, a multi-scale and adaptive multi-period forecasting framework that integrates temporal decomposition, dynamic frequency-period identification, and a newly designed Compression-Fusion Attention Block (CFABlock) for cross-period representation learning. The architecture leverages FFT-derived adaptive periods to capture seasonal-trend components and employs compression-fusion attention to enhance feature discrimination across temporal scales. Furthermore, this work provides the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art forecasting models, including Informer, Autoformer, iTransformer, TimesNet, DLinear, and TimeMixer, to the domain of cold storage load prediction.
