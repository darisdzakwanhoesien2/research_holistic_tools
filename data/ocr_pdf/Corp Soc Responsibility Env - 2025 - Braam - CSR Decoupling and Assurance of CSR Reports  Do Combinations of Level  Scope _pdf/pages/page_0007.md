where CSR DECOUPLING$_{ii}$ represents the measures for CSR decoupling for firm $i$ in year $t$ as discussed earlier; the level of assurance $(\text{LEVEL}_{ii-1})$, scope of assurance $(\text{SCOPE}_{ii-1})$, the type of assurance provider $(\text{PROVIDER}_{ii-1})$, and their combinations are used to explain variation in CSR decoupling while controlling for the other variables in our model. We used one-year lagged effects for the CSR assurance-related choices as the influence of the CSR assurance practices might not immediately affect CSR decoupling, and thus approach causality. To

account for the fact that the lagged effects of CSR assurance-related options on CSR decoupling may vary depending on the presence of the other assurance-related choices, we examined the interaction effects between different assurance-related choices. Finally, our panel data analysis incorporated year fixed effects to control for time effects and random effects at both the firm and country levels to control for variations across firms and countries. The Pearson's $r$ correlations shown in Panel B of Table 3 as well as the variance inflation factors (unreported) suggest no multicollinearity.
