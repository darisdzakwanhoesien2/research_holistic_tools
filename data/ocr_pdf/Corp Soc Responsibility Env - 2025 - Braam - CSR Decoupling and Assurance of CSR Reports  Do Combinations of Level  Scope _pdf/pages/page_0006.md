TABLE 2 | Variable definitions.

|  Dependent variables  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  CSR DECOUPLINGit | Calculated as the difference between the external normalized score in year t and the internal normalized score in year t-1 for firm i in year t. Higher values indicate more CSR decoupling.  |
|  SCALED CSR DECOUPLINGit | Relative, size-adjusted measure of CSR decoupling calculated as the ratio of CSR decoupling to the natural logarithm of total assets for firm i in year t.  |
|  Independent variables  |   |
|  CSR ASSURANCEit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the sustainability report of firm i in year t was assured by an independent CSR assurance provider, and 0 otherwise.  |
|  LEVELit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if reasonable assurance was provided for the sustainability report of firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise, that is, limited assurance.  |
|  SCOPEit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the scope of the independent assurance provided covers the entire sustainability report of firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise.  |
|  PROVIDERit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the assurance provider of firm i in year t is a member of the auditing profession, and 0 if the assurance is not provided by an accounting firm (Simnett et al. 2009).  |
|  Control variables at firm and country level  |   |
|  SIZEit | Natural logarithm of the company i's year-end total assets.  |
|  LEVERAGEit | Total debt for firm i in year t, measured as a percentage of total assets.  |
|  ROAit-1 | Return on assets for firm i in year t-1, measured as net income divided by total assets.  |
|  ESGit | Combined ESG score for firm i in year t, based on the reported information in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars as obtained from the ESG database in LSEG Workspace.  |
|  R&Dit | Proxy for innovation, measured as the expenses in research and development divided by total sales for firm i in year t (Tashman et al. 2019).  |
|  CAPITAL INTENSITYit | Ratio of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets for firm i in year t (Marquis et al. 2016; Tashman et al. 2019).  |
|  DISCLOSURE REGULATIONit | Dummy variable coded as 1 if a company i in year t has to comply with mandatory CSR disclosure regulation (Krueger et al. 2024), and 0 other wise.  |
|  STAKEHOLDER ORIENTATIONi | Dummy variable coded as 1 if a company i is headquartered in a stakeholder-oriented country, and 0 if a company i is headquartered in a shareholder-oriented or other country.  |

Tashman et al. 2019), was included because capital-intensive firms typically have greater financial resources, which may influence their approach to CSR initiatives and assurance practices. In addition, we controlled for whether firms were subject to mandatory CSR disclosure regulations (Krueger et al. 2024).

To control for sector-specific effects, we controlled for industry differences based on a categorization of industries with the use of the two-digit SIC codes (Industry dummies). To account for country-level effects, we distinguished between companies that were headquartered in a stakeholder-oriented versus shareholder-oriented and other countries (Ballou et al. 2018; Braam and Peeters 2018; Simnett et al. 2009). Table 2

summarizes the definitions of the dependent, explanatory, and control variables used in our analyses. Table 3 presents the summary statistics for these variables.

# 3.3 | Research Model

We tested our hypotheses using multilevel mixed-effects linear panel data regression analyses as our panel data set has a multilevel structure with repeated measurements at the firm level that are nested within countries. This approach accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and mitigates the risk of heteroscedasticity (Lindner et al. 2021). To test Hypotheses 1-3, we used the following model:
