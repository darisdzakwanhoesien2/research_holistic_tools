and free from material misstatements, thereby aiming to reduce CSR decoupling and enhance the overall quality of CSR reporting (Christensen et al. 2021; Ballou et al. 2018; Sethi et al. 2017). In parallel, policymakers have increasingly integrated assurance requirements into CSR disclosure regulations to improve the credibility of reported information at a systemic level. For instance, the EU has adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which initially mandates limited assurance for CSR disclosures. Similarly, other jurisdictions, such as South Africa, have introduced assurance obligations for CSR information (Ackers and Eccles 2015). However, both in voluntary and mandatory settings, CSR assurance may vary considerably in terms of the level and scope of assurance, and the choice of the assurance provider. The level of assurance ranges from reasonable assurance to limited assurance, and the scope of assurance may cover the entire report or be limited to specific sections. For an independent assurance provider, companies can choose assurance providers from either the auditing profession or non-auditing professions.

In voluntary settings, managers from companies with poor CSR performance facing public pressures and legitimacy threats may strategically benefit from less comprehensive assurance practices (i.e. limited instead of reasonable assurance and a narrower scope of assurance) to proactively shape stakeholders' perceptions of the credibility of the CSR information disclosed, while deflecting attention from poor CSR performance (Unerman 2008; O'Dwyer et al. 2011; Perego and Kolk 2012). They may exercise their managerial discretion to primarily use CSR assurance as a self-serving risk management tool to enhance external legitimacy and corporate reputation through symbolic communication about their CSR actions in CSR reports, without being adequately supported by substantive CSR actions (Bothello et al. 2023; García-Sánchez et al. 2022; Bromley and Powell 2012; Marquis et al. 2016; Velte 2021). Such practices raise doubts about the actual effectiveness of CSR assurance in reducing CSR decoupling and in enhancing the transparency and decision-usefulness of CSR reports for investors and other stakeholders (Boiral et al. 2019; Talbot and Boiral 2018; Michelon et al. 2015).

In mandatory settings, policymakers face important cost--benefit trade-offs when determining the appropriate level and scope of assurance in disclosure regulations (Leuz and Wysocki 2016; Christensen et al. 2021). These trade-offs have recently become evident in the EU Omnibus discussions (European Commission 2025), which ultimately led to the abandonment of the initially ambitious goal of requiring reasonable assurance for CSR disclosures aimed at elevating their quality to the level of financial reporting for all firms subject to the CSRD. To assess and evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure regulations in enhancing CSR reporting quality and credibility, it is important to develop a deeper understanding of how variations in CSR assurance choices may relate to variations in CSR decoupling. Specifically, the influence of combinations of CSR assurance choices on CSR decoupling remains underexplored (Aboud et al. 2024).

In this study, we aim to enhance understanding of the relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. To this end, we examine how combinations of assurance level, assurance scope, and the type of assurance provider are associated with reductions in CSR decoupling. Using a unique international panel dataset of publicly listed firms from 2010 to 2022, the results show that reductions in CSR decoupling are significantly negatively associated with the combination of reasonable assurance and a broad scope of assurance, as well as with reasonable assurance and providers from the auditing profession. This highlights the importance of comprehensive assurance practices in meaningfully addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance.

Our study contributes to ongoing research on the effectiveness of CSR assurance in enhancing CSR reporting quality by being among the first to systematically examine how combinations of CSR assurance choices relate to CSR decoupling (García-Sánchez et al. 2022; Braam and Peeters 2018; Hodge et al. 2009). The findings indicate that the CSR assurance process can help reduce CSR decoupling when reasonable assurance is combined with a broad scope or when reasonable assurance is provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession. They suggest that adopting a CSR assurance approach that exceeds the minimum standards, particularly through combinations involving reasonable assurance, can have synergistic effects in mitigating CSR decoupling.

However, the findings show no significant relationships between reductions in CSR decoupling and combinations of limited assurance and other assurance-related choices, indicating that limited assurance is not effective in mitigating CSR decoupling. Instead, our findings suggest that limited assurance primarily serves a symbolic function, enhancing perceived legitimacy, stakeholder trust, and corporate reputation while having little effect on reducing CSR decoupling, and may even contribute to its increase. These findings have important implications for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. From a cost--benefit perspective, the findings are policy-relevant as they inform policymakers about the potential benefits of a comprehensive assurance approach to improving the quality of CSR reporting. Additionally, they help investors and other stakeholders better understand the role of CSR assurance in enhancing the credibility of CSR reports.

## 2 Theoretical Background and Development of Hypotheses

CSR assurance should ensure that the information disclosed in CSR reports is, in all material respects, reliable and accurate, in compliance with reporting standards, and, for this reason, verifiable. It should signal the credibility of corporate CSR disclosures, enhance stakeholders' confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the information disclosed (Brown-Liburd et al. 2018; García-Sánchez et al. 2022). The process of independent assurance can encourage companies to strengthen their risk management systems, enhance the stakeholders' engagement processes, and improve their accounting systems and reporting practices, enabling them to produce and disclose more reliable and accurate CSR information (Michelon et al. 2015; Braam and Peeters 2018). This, in turn, helps lessen the gap between CSR disclosures and actual performance (Sauerwald and Su 2019), improves
