Note: Table 2 shows the definitions of the variables. ***p&lt;0.01, **p&lt;0.05, *p&lt;0.1 (standard errors in parentheses).
*Models 1 and 2 show the results for the full sample. Models 3 and 4 present the results for the subsample of companies with CSR assurance on their CSR reports. In addition, Models 1 and 3 use the Scaled CSR decoupling measure, while Models 2 and 4 use the CSR decoupling measure.
