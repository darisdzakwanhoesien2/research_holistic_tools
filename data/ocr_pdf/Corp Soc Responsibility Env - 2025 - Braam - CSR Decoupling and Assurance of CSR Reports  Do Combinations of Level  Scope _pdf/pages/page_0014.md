a practitioner from the auditing profession—does not reduce CSR decoupling, nor does it increase the likelihood that CSR disclosures are fairly presented and free from material misstatements. Specifically, the results suggest that limited assurance—whether mandatory or voluntary—may primarily serve a symbolic rather than substantive role, as its actual impact on the quality and reliability of CSR disclosures appears limited. Accordingly, the decision of EU policymakers to drop the ambitious goal to implement reasonable assurance of CSR information under the Omnibus regulation raises concerns that, despite growing societal demands for corporate accountability and transparency regarding CSR performance and corporate impact on society and the environment, limited assurance may produce unintended adverse effects (Aboud et al. 2024). However, such an approach entails substantial costs and implementation challenges, which lie beyond the scope of this study.

Our findings can further be helpful for investors and other stakeholders in assessing the credibility and reliability of the CSR information presented in CSR reports. Our findings suggest that CSR assurance is not "automatically" associated with management's commitment to credible CSR disclosures, increased transparency, and a higher CSR reporting quality (Michelon et al. 2015).

Finally, our study has certain limitations, including those related to the potential influence of unobservable factors that may affect CSR assurance and CSR decoupling, potentially leading to endogeneity issues. Although we have included different measures of CSR decoupling and conducted several robustness tests, future studies could further investigate the conditions under which CSR assurance enhances or inhibits the development of higher-quality CSR reporting and increased transparency, ultimately facilitating more responsible business practices. Additionally, future studies could examine the cost implications of CSR assurance, including those related to the assurance level, scope, and the choice of assurance provider to advance our understanding of the consequences of regulating CSR assurance.

1. The decision to retain limited assurance, rather than transitioning to the more extensive and costly reasonable assurance, was motivated by the EU's aim to reduce compliance costs and administrative burdens. Moreover, limited assurance provides companies with greater flexibility by enabling adaptability to emerging issues without the rigidity of formal standards, and by placing greater emphasis on materiality assessments.
2. Enhanced stakeholder confidence in the credibility of disclosed CSR information may result in competitive advantages, including improved access to finance (Cheng et al. 2014), lower cost of equity capital (Dhaliwal et al. 2011; Martinez-Ferrero and Garcia-Sanchez 2017), increased analyst coverage, lower analyst forecast errors, lower monitoring costs (Dhaliwal et al. 2012; Casey and Grenier 2015), and higher future cash flows (Lys et al. 2015; Plumlee et al. 2015).
3. In their article, Hawn and Ioannou (2016) referred to the online version of Appendix S1, titled "The Composition of Internal and External Actions' Indices". Appendix S1 provides the complete list of the 24 external and 21 internal actions, and enables an exact replication of their classification and measurement approach. The two omitted external actions are: (13) "Is the company's CSR report published in accordance with the GRI guidelines?" and (22) "Does the company have an external auditor of its CSR/H&amp;S/Sustainability report?".
