Note: Table 2 shows the definitions of the variables. ***p&lt;0.01, **p&lt;0.05, *p&lt;0.1 (firm-level clustered and heteroscedasticity-adjusted standard errors in parentheses). Panel A shows the results for the full sample, while Panel B presents the results for the subsample of companies with CSR assurance on their CSR reports.
aModels 1 and 2 use the scaled CSR decoupling measure. Models 3 and 4 use the CSR decoupling measure.
