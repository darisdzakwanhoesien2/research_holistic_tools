# ABSTRACT

In response to growing concerns about the credibility of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, this study examines the relationship between external assurance on CSR reports and CSR decoupling. Specifically, we explore how combinations of the level and scope of assurance, and the type of assurance provider are associated with a reduction in CSR decoupling. Using an international sample of publicly listed firms, we find that CSR decoupling is significantly reduced when firms obtain reasonable assurance together with either a broad assurance scope or an assurance provider from the auditing profession. These results suggest that reasonable assurance provides a necessary foundation for reducing CSR decoupling, but its effectiveness is contingent on its combination with either a broad assurance scope or an assurance provider from the auditing profession. This highlights the importance of comprehensive CSR assurance practices in meaningfully addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance, whereas CSR assurance practices that meet only the minimum standards primarily serve a symbolic role, enhancing legitimacy. We discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers and investors.

# 1 | Introduction

This study examines the relationship between external assurance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and CSR decoupling. In response to growing pressures from investors and other stakeholders to become more accountable for the impacts of their activities on the environment and society, companies are expected—or even legally obliged—to enhance transparency. Although they increasingly disclose information on CSR performance (Lin et al. 2024), stakeholders remain concerned about CSR decoupling. Prior literature defines CSR decoupling as “a symbolic strategy whereby firms overstate their CSR performance in their disclosures to strengthen their legitimacy” (Tashman et al. 2019, 154; see also García-Sánchez et al. 2022;

Sauerwald and Su 2019). Companies may use CSR decoupling as a strategic tool to shape stakeholders' perceptions by communicating CSR actions that are not matched by substantive efforts (Hawn and Ioannou 2016; Marquis et al. 2016; Cho and Patten 2007).

To address increasing concerns from investors and other stakeholders about the credibility and reliability of the CSR information presented in CSR reports, CSR assurance serves as an external monitoring mechanism to enhance stakeholders' confidence in the credibility of the CSR information disclosed (Adams and Evans 2004; Brown-Liburd and Zamora 2015; Du and Wu 2019). For companies, obtaining external assurance signals that their reported CSR performance is fairly presented
