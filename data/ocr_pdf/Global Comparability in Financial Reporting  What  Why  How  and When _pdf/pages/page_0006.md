ing that ‘we would never account for Entity B’s assets using different currencies and that would be true’. However, the distinction between using different currencies for Entity B’s assets and using different measurements for different assets for Entity A is not clear. Why do we recoil at one and accept the other without question? One likely reason is that we are not accustomed to one but are accustomed to the other. Is there any other reason?

Can we achieve comparability if we measure the same asset in different ways – either for the same entity or different entities? For example, presently we treat computers as inventory for some entities (e.g., Apple) and as equipment for others (e.g., General Electric). We treat warranty obligations relating to sales of goods by retailers differently from insurance contracts issued by insurance companies even though they are both insurance contracts. We treat real estate as investment property for some entities (and measure it at fair value) and as property, plant, and equipment for others (and measure it at amortized cost). We treat the gain or loss on an item designated as hedged in a fair value hedge differently from the same gain or loss on an item that is not so designated (i.e., in a designated fair value hedge, we adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item for its change in value attributable to the hedged risk). In addition, we permit optional asset revaluation, application of fair value, and hedge accounting itself. All of these differences result in differences in amounts in the financial statements for what seem to be the same assets and liabilities.

Consider an example. Assume Entity A and Entity B each buys a piece of construction equipment for 200. Entity A classifies the equipment as inventory and Entity B classifies it as property, plant, and equipment. Six months later, both entities still own the equipment; Entity A holds it in inventory and B has depreciated it because it is available for use, but Entity B has not used it. Entities A and B both dispose of the equipment for a gain. In its income statement, Entity A displays revenue and expense, which net to the amount of the gain, and Entity B displays the gain net. The asset – a piece of construction equipment – is the same for both entities. Yet, the asset is measured at different amounts and the gain on disposal of the asset is presented differently. The question is whether the financial statements of Entities A and B are comparable.

Consider another example, which is often used to illustrate this issue. Assume that Bank A and Bank B each buys US Treasury securities at a cost of US$ 1 million. At the reporting date, the fair value of the securities is US$ 1.2 million. Bank A classifies the securities as trading (or fair value through profit or loss) and recognizes US$ 1.2 million in assets and a gain of US$ 0.2 million. Bank B classifies the securities as held to maturity (or amortized cost) and recognizes US$ 1.0 million in assets and no gain or loss. In both cases, the bank owns the same asset – US Treasury securities – purchased for the same amount – US$ 1 million – and now worth the same amount – US$ 1.2 million. Yet the financial statements of Bank A and Bank B are quite different. Does this financial reporting make like things look alike? That is, are the financial statements of Entities A and B comparable? The answer is ‘no’.

## Does ‘use’ of an asset affect its economics?

A question relating to comparability to which we do not have a good answer is whether two assets that seem the same (e.g., computers) are economically the same if they are used differently (e.g., as inventory or property, plant, and equipment). If the use of an asset affects its economics, we need to identify how the economics are affected so that we can determine whether and how the differences in economics should be reflected
