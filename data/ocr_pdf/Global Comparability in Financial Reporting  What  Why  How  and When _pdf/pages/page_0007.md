when accounting for the asset. Accountants have been treating seemingly similar assets differently for a long time -- the inventory versus property, plant, and equipment example is not new. However, we have never articulated why. Without knowing why different uses of an asset affect the economics of the asset that should be reflected in the accounting, it is not possible to determine when and how to reflect such differences. In addition, we need to know whether the notion of different uses of assets applies to all assets. In particular, does it apply to financial assets and liabilities? IFRS 13 concludes ‘no' and explains why. But more thought needs to be devoted to this notion as it applies to non-financial assets.

Recently, the notion that the use of assets should affect the accounting for the assets has been characterized as reflecting an entity's ‘business model'. Thus, the question can be rephrased as whether different ‘use' of an asset depends on the entity's ‘business model'. Unfortunately, the Conceptual Framework has no concepts about the role of business model in financial reporting. In addition, there is no definition of a business model and, thus, it is unclear what the term means. Some question whether an entity's business model differs in any substantive way from management intent (Leisenring, Linsmeier, Schipper, & Trott, 2012). Is the business model something that management is doing, plans to do, or only hopes to do? Is an entity's business model verifiable? Is it auditable? The answers to these questions are not obvious, which only adds to the lack of clarity about why and how a business model or intent should affect financial reporting.

## What does research say?

Academic research provides evidence that global financial reporting with greater comparability can be beneficial to investors, by lowering costs of comparing cross-border investment opportunities and, for some countries and firms, by improving the quality of their financial reporting information. Research also shows that comparability can be beneficial to firms by increasing cross-border investment and by lowering cost of capital, presumably from reducing information risk and, for some, by increasing financial reporting quality. However, research also provides evidence that these potential benefits are tempered by cross-country differences in implementation, incentives, and enforcement.

One example of a study in this literature is ‘Market Reaction to the Adoption of IFRS in Europe' (Armstrong, Barth, Jagolinzer, & Riedl, 2010). The questions motivating this study are: (1) did investors perceive net benefits to adoption of IFRS in Europe? and (2) if there were net benefits, are the net benefits associated with increased comparability or increased quality of financial reporting information? As with any single research study, this study cannot directly answer these questions. However, these motivating questions lead to two research questions that the study can answer. The first is: did the European stock market react positively (negatively) to regulatory events that increased (decreased) the likelihood of IFRS adoption in Europe? An affirmative answer to this question indicates that investors perceived net benefits to IFRS adoption in Europe. The second is: were there differences across firms depending on their pre-adoption information environment? Identifying differences across firms in the market reaction to the regulatory events provides insights into what firm characteristics are associated with the perceived benefits of IFRS adoption.

The study focuses on 16 regulatory events, which begin with the 2002 European Parliament resolution requiring all listed firms in the European Union to apply IFRS by 2005. The events end with the 2005 European Commission endorsement of the revised fair value option. The events and predicted signs of the effect on the likelihood of IFRS adop
