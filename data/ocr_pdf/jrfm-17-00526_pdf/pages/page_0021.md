The table shows the results of the Dynamic Panel estimation of the models above in the text. Cod is the after-tax cost of debt = pre-tax cost of debt (1 - tax rate). The average effective tax rate for the sector is used for this computation. Coe1 is estimated using the capital asset pricing model: cost of equity = risk-free rate + beta (risk premium). The average beta for the sector is used. I use the long-term treasury bond rate as the risk-free rate and a 5.5% risk premium. Coe2 is the dividend yield of the stock plus the reinvestment rate times the roe. Wacc is the market-weighted cod and coe1. Roe is the net income divided by the book value of equity. Fcf = EBIT(1-t) - (capital expenditures - depreciation) - change in non-cash working capital. Tobin's Q is estimated using the methodology of Peters and Taylor (2017). ESG is the Refinitiv ESG score. Greenwash75% is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the Greenwash score of the firm is greater than or equal to 0.5432797, and 0 otherwise. Beta is estimated by regressing weekly returns on stock against the local index using 5 years of data. Capitalized R&amp;D is R&amp;D expenses amortized over five years at the cost of capital. Cash is Cash and Marketable Securities reported in the balance sheet. Debt to capital is the market value of debt divided by the market value of debt plus the market value of equity. Institutions is the shares held by institutions/shares outstanding. Liquidity is the average number of shares traded divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market cap is the estimated market value of shares outstanding, obtained by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the share price. Net cap exp is capital expenditures - depreciation. Prs is the political risk variable for the home country from ICRG. Sd is the standard deviation of daily stock returns over the year. Industry, year, and country effects are controlled for but not reported to save space. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** signify significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The Sargan Test Stat. tests the null hypothesis of no endogeneity.
