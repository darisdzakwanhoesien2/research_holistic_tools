Kim and Lyon (2015) extend the literature by incorporating the idea of undue modesty by firms in environmental advertising. They call this “brownwashing”. They then look at the difference in drivers between greenwashing and brownwashing firms. They find that firm growth leads to greenwashing as a result of anticipation of increased interactions with stakeholders in the regulatory environment. They find that deregulation and lower profits lead to brownwashing.

Testa et al. (2018a) analyze the impact of different types of environmental communication strategies on firm value and operating performance using a panel of 3490 publicly traded companies from 58 countries and 19 industries. They find that greenwashing does not pay, whereas brownwashing is associated with lower financial performance.

Sun and Zhang (2019) provide an evolutionary game theoretical model of greenwashing, allowing for government regulation. They find that while government regulation can inhibit greenwashing, government tax subsidies will still encourage greenwashing to some extent.

Ghitti et al. (2020) propose a measure of greenwashing based on the difference between the Newsweek Green Rankings and the Datastream Environmental, Social, and Governance score. They find that the greenwashing measure negatively affects Tobin's Q estimate and conclude that greenwashing decreases the firm's value in the long run. They also find that the greenwashing variable is negatively affected by corporate board size and whether the firm adheres to Global Reporting Initiative reporting and positively to corporate board independence.

Li et al. (2023) examine the effect of greenwashing on corporate financial performance as measured by return on assets. They used the information on 735 Chinese firms from 2013 to 2017. They find that greenwashing has a positive effect on return on assets. This relationship is weakened by local environmental regulation and reversed by low media favorability.

Li et al. (2023) present evidence that greenwashing exerts a positive influence on corporate financial performance (CFP). However, they note that this effect diminishes under stringent environmental regulations and is entirely negated when media coverage is unfavorable towards firms in China.

In their 2023 study, Xia and colleagues analyze a cohort of Chinese firms, uncovering compelling evidence that corporations often resort to greenwashing their environmental performance primarily in anticipation of future investment and financing needs. Furthermore, the research reveals a pronounced tendency for companies burdened with higher debt levels to engage in such deceptive practices.

The literature thus far on the financial effects of greenwashing has focused entirely on the returns side of finance, with little attention paid to risk.

## 3. Materials and Methods

### 3.1. Data

The ESG data are from Refinitiv. I use the CSRStrategy (a score that reflects a company's practices to communicate that it integrates the economic (financial), social, and environmental dimensions into its day-to-day decision-making processes), Emissions (a score that measures a company's commitment and effectiveness towards reducing environmental emission in the production and operational processes), and ResourceUse (a score that reflects a company's performance and capacity to reduce the use of materials, energy or water, and to find more eco-efficient solutions by improving supply chain management (Thompson Reuters Eikon 2017). I divide the demeaned CSRStrategy score by the mean of the Emissions score and the ResourceUse score. The idea here is that greenwashing firms will advertise their environmental accomplishments more than they act upon them. The definition of greenwashing measured here follows that of de Freitas Netto et al. (2020). It captures all aspects of their three definitions of greenwashing. The variable is then regressed against the overall ESG score for each firm and the error term is taken as the measure of greenwashing. Table 1 gives the basic statistics on the Greenwash score for all
