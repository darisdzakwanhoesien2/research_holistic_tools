5. Discussion

I develop a greenwashing metric for 3973 companies across 70 countries, covering the period from 2012 to 2022, using Refinitiv ESG component scores. This metric utilizes the CSRStrategy score, which indicates a company's approach to integrating economic, social, and environmental considerations into its decision-making. This score is divided by the average of the Emissions score, which assesses a company's dedication and effectiveness in reducing environmental emissions, and the ResourceUse score, which evaluates a company's ability to minimize the use of materials, energy, or water while enhancing eco-efficiency through better supply chain management (Thompson Reuters Eikon 2017). The resulting variable is then regressed against the Refinitiv ESG score, and the residual becomes the Greenwash score. This regression helps differentiate the impacts of greenwashing from actual ESG activities, a topic that has been overlooked in the existing literature (Ruiz-Blanco et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2020). The Greenwash score aligns closely with the greenwashing definitions provided by de Freitas Netto et al. (2020).

I categorize the data into groups based on the Greenwash variable, with Greenwash75% representing firms in the highest quartile of Greenwash scores and Greenwash25% representing those in the lowest quartile, which are characterized as “brownwashing” firms, which are those that perform better environmentally than they disclose. According to Huang et al. (2020) and Marquis et al. (2016), greenwashing is more prevalent in emerging markets due to factors like unfair competition, easily misled consumers, and weak government enforcement. However, the data in Table 2 indicate no significant difference in the percentages of the Greenwash75% and Greenwash25% firms across different market types. While the average Greenwash score is slightly higher in emerging markets (1.13) compared to developed markets (1.16), this difference is not statistically significant. The results reveal that higher political risk correlates with lower greenwashing scores, suggesting that firms are less likely to greenwash in more stable countries. Political risk is particularly influential in emerging markets (Bilson et al. 2002). I used the MSCI definition for emerging markets, and a different definition might yield varied results, warranting further exploration. While Huang et al. (2020) suggest that emerging markets are more conducive to greenwashing due to lower competition, I do not find evidence supporting this claim.

There are notable distinctions between greenwashing firms and brownwashing firms. Greenwashing firms generally have a lower weighted average cost of capital, although their component costs of capital do not differ significantly. This difference may be attributed to their higher debt-to-capital ratio, indicating that they utilize a greater proportion of inexpensive debt financing to reduce their overall cost of capital. Additionally, greenwashing firms are usually larger and have a greater share of institutional ownership. On average, they also provide lower dividend yields and are often based in politically stable countries. Furthermore, greenwashing firms display less firm-specific risk compared to brownwashing firms, as evidenced by their standard deviation means.

There is no significant difference in the ESG scores between the two samples. Greenwashing firms have more ESG-related controversy scores than brownwashing firms. By design, greenwashing is higher in advertising their ESG efforts and lower in Emissions and ResourceUse. Greenwashing firms are significantly behind brownwashing firms in respecting human and worker rights, product responsibility, shareholder rights, community responsibility, and environmental innovation. This indicates that greenwashing firms not only fail to adhere to advertised environmental goals, they also fail to adhere to social and governance goals. The reason they do not differ in ESG scores may be due to overemphasis in weighting on ESG communication and advertising in the overall ESG score by the Refinitiv methodology.

What are the effects of greenwashing on the cost of financing for the firm? The issue is complicated by the relationship between the effects of ESG disclosure and greenwashing. I have tried to address this by regressing the Greenwash variable on the ESG score. The relevant literature shows that higher ESG scores lead to a lower cost of debt (Raimo et al. (2021), Eliwa et al. (2021), and Apergis et al. (2022)). And that higher ESG scores lead
