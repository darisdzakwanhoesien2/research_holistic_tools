note a significantly positive relationship between ESG controversies (ESGcontro) and defensive style in SR CEO letters (Model (3)), providing support for H2a. H2b is, however, not supported, as we observe no significant relationship between ESG controversies score and assertive IM (Model (2)).

In Models (4) up to (6), we added the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro to test the hypotheses regarding the moderating effect (H3a and H3b). The results indicate a significantly positive interaction effect for the defensive style (Model (6)), that supports our H3a. The lack of a statistically significant coefficient on ESGcontro in Model 6 suggests that it is companies from sensitive industries that are more prone to resort to defensive IM when controversies arise. Figure 1 depicts that the positive relationship between ESGcontro and defensiveness is observed only in sensitive industries, while it remains insignificant (indicated by a flat line) in non-sensitive industries. We find no statistically significant interaction effect in Model (5) (H3b was not supported).

Regarding our transparency-related control variables, our results show a positive effect of the DIStransparency on the use of formal-analytical style (b = .0013, p &lt; 0.01) and a negative effect on the assertive style (b = -.0012, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, our findings indicate a negative relationship between formal-analytical style and GRI (b = -.0192, p &lt; 0.5) and a positive association between assertive style and the use of these reporting standards (b = .0211, p &lt; 0.5). With respect to the corporate governance controls, assertive style seems to be constrained in the presence of larger boards (b = -.0058, p &lt; 0.01) and CSR committee (b = -.0192, p &lt; 0.1). Firms with larger representation of women on board tend to use less formal-analytical (b = -.0007, p &lt; 0.05) and more defensive language (0.0010, p&lt;0.01). Finally, both region dummies (UK and US) move in the same direction in comparison with the EU institutional setting for formal-analytical and assertive styles, that is both UK and US negatively affect the use of formal-analytical style (b = -.0707; b = -.0625, p &lt; 0.01); while positively affect the use of assertive style (b = .0522; b = .1272, p &lt; 0.01). Regarding the defensive style, however, we observe a significant effect from the UK companies (b = .0496, p &lt; 0.01), whereas no significant effect is noted from the US companies; yet both of the effects are in the same direction. According to Matten and Moon's (2008) perspective, these discrepancies could be associated with unique institutional arrangements at the regional level. Matten and Moon's (2008) implicit-explicit CSR framework suggests that both US- and UK-oriented CSR tends to be more explicit in comparison to the European-style CSR, which provides more room for corporate initiative and therefore both assertive and defensive IM. The prominence of active private investors with a short-term outlook and shareholder value oriented institutional investors in the Anglo-Saxon countries would increase awareness for and salience of public image and tend to encourage IM.

As our results show, companies operating in sensitive industries tend to use a more formal-analytical style in the SR CEO letters. Such language is rather formal, logical, and hierarchically structured in terms of how information is presented and tends to avoid the need to focus on people and actions. This suggests that the greater scrutiny and governance pressures
