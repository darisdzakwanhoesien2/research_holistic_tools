## 5.1. Descriptive statistics

Table VI provides descriptive statistics to present the overall characteristics of the companies included in the sample. 38% of our observations come from sensitive industries. The mean value for the ESG controversy score is 0.22. While the majority (76%) of the firms adhere to GRI standards, only about half of them were subject to independent assurance and the mean value of disclosure transparency (DIStransparency) among these firms is 47.01. With regard to corporate governance practices, the majority of the sample companies have CSR/sustainability committees at the board level, as well as CEO and Chairman of the Board separation. The sample companies reveal variation in terms of board size (with a mean of 11 members), independence (with 75% of independent directors on average) and board gender diversity (with 23% female board members on average). Performance statistics reveal a mean of 66.43 for EnvSoc and of 5.51 for ROA. The sample companies are quite similar though with respect to size, with a mean and standard deviation of company size of 23.44 and 1.44, respectively¹⁰.

Table VII presents a correlation matrix. We note that membership in sensitive industries (INDsen) is negatively correlated with two identified rhetorical IM profiles (assertive and defensive), while positively correlated with the formal-analytical style (Analytic), which provides initial support for our hypotheses (H1a and H1b). Correlation analysis also indicates that our issue visibility variable (ESGcontro) is positively correlated with defensive IM and negatively with formal-analytical style. These results provide support for our expectation regarding the prominence of defensive IM (H2a), but not for our hypothesis on the relationship between issue visibility and assertive IM (H2b). Moreover, sensitive industry membership is positively correlated with the use of GRI and overall disclosure transparency, suggesting that companies in sensitive industries value accountability and transparency to sustain legitimacy. The correlations among our independent variables do not indicate multicollinearity.

## 5.2. Multivariate analysis

The results based on the empirical models are reported in Table VIII. In the first three models, we tested the direct relationship (i.e., main effect) between our dependent and test variables (excluding the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro). Model (1) shows that, in line with our expectations (H1a), companies operating in sensitive industries disclose more formal and analytical SR CEO letters (i.e., significantly positive coefficient for INDsen - b = -.019, p &lt; 0.10). Model (2) documents a significantly negative relationship between INDsen and the assertive style (b = -.029, p &lt; 0.05). The results could indicate that the effect of general visibility pertains only to assertive IM and provide partial support for our hypothesis (H1b). We further

¹⁰ The sample exhibits a bias towards larger firms, resulting in limited variation in terms of firm size. This observation further supports the argument that firm size should not be used as a proxy for general visibility.
