industry (Shakil, 2021). The controversies score is expressed as a percentage rank, where a higher score implies fewer controversies. For a more straightforward interpretation, we reverse-coded the controversies score (i.e., presence of controversies is equal to 1; and no controversies is equal to 0). To test the industry moderation effect (H3) we include the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro.

Our models also include a number of control variables. To account for the interplay between sections of the report (CEO letter versus main report), we add the following two general disclosure transparency variables. First, we use a GRI dummy variable indicating whether the company follows the GRI standards/guidelines in its disclosure process. While the implementation of GRI may suggest greater transparency (Graafland and Smid, 2019), empirical evidence indicates that given the voluntary character of the framework, it is often used in a symbolic manner (Boiral, 2013; Michelon et al., 2015). Hence, we introduce Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score (DIStransparency) as a second transparency-related control variable, widely used in prior literature as a proxy for corporate transparency and accountability in sustainability (García-Sánchez et al., 2022). Bloomberg's analysts track companies' disclosure on more than 800 environmental, social and governance metrics, both qualitative and quantitative. The score ranges from 0.1 for companies that disclose a minimum amount of ESG data to 100 for those that disclose every data point collected by Bloomberg. The score is comparable across sectors and regions.

Further, as prior literature indicates, companies can simultaneously be involved in sustainability controversies while demonstrating strong social and environmental performance in other areas (Price and Sun, 2017), which may lead to differing effects on corporate disclosure behavior (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). Hence, we control for the mean of Refinitiv's environmental and social scores as the proxy for overall environmental and social performance (EnvSoc) (Ioannou and Serafeim, 2012). Additionally, to control for organizational characteristics mechanisms that may influence IM behavior we employ corporate governance variables including an assurance dummy variable (Assur) indicating whether a company's report was subject to external verification, CSR/sustainability committee (CSRcom), percentage of female directors on board (BRDwmn), board size (BRDsize), percentage of independent board directors (BRDind) and CEO duality (CEOdual). As firm-level financial controls, we use ROA as a proxy of a company's profitability, and the natural logarithm of total assets as an indicator of the company's size (Size). Consistent with established literature on the country-level institutional determinants of IM (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Liu and Liu, 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020), we also incorporate regional dummy variables (UK and US) to control for company location. Finally, we control for the time trend including year dummies in the model. Table V summarizes our variables.

The hypotheses are tested using random effects models that allowed us to estimate the effects of our time-invariant variable of interest (INDsen). The choice of the model was supported by the results of the Mundlak tests (Mundlak, 1978). For assertive and defensive as explained variables tests showed: Chi-squared(12) = 18.01, Prob &gt; Chi-squared = .113; Chi-squared(13) = 20.91, Prob &gt; Chi-squared = .052, respectively. These results indicate that there is no correlation between time-invariant unobservables and regressors, hence we reject the null hypotheses and conclude that the random effects models apply.
