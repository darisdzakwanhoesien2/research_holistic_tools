in those industries, compel management to present their sustainability efforts in a more structured, somewhat detached and low-risk manner. Similarly, there is a significant negative relationship between operating in sensitive industries and assertive storytelling style. Whereas CEOs in non-sensitive industries tend to invest in authoritative, confident and outward-facing language that reflects leadership, certainty and being in control through assertive storytelling, such tendencies are significantly lower in sensitive industries. This indicates a more cautious approach in sensitive industries, probably to avoid backlash or skepticism from stakeholders. However, the significantly positive interaction effect for the defensive style indicates that companies operating in sensitive industries are more likely to adopt a defensive stance when facing high levels of ESG controversies. So, when the company is directly faced with mediatized sustainability controversies, the CEO tends to take the stage to explain, make sense or contextualize the issues involved in a more reactive fashion, probably to protect the company's legitimacy and mitigate potential negative perceptions. Our results also suggest that as general disclosure transparency increases, CEOs are less inclined to take on an assertive posture of leadership and control. Instead, they increasingly rely on formal, low-risk information sharing (i.e., analytic). Opposite results are found for GRI-based reports, which might suggest a largely symbolic function of this voluntary disclosure framework.

To evaluate the robustness of our findings against potential bias due to the skewed distribution of ESGcontro $^{11}$ , we re-estimate our primary models for the subsample of observations with reported ESG controversies (ESGcontro&gt;0). The results (Table IX) show that the direct effect of sensitive industry membership (INDsen) and ESG controversies (ESGcontro) yield the same sign, yet the statistical significance decreases (and even disappears) for some of the previously observed effects (so in Models (1) and (3)). When the interaction term is included (Models (4) and (6)), coefficients do attain statistical significance (which is in line with the main analyses). We associate the decrease in significance levels with the smaller sample size used for the robustness check. Nevertheless, the results of the robustness check qualitatively support our primary findings.

# 6. Discussion and conclusion

CEO narratives are a powerful tool to shape public perception of a company's sustainability track record and of its alignment with societal norms and values. A SR CEO letter holds considerable leeway in highlighting key messages and themes, while the body of the report offers substantiation with more detailed information, data, and context, often in concert with institutionalized reporting formats. Prior research documents that CEO letters tend to be used for legitimacy purposes, portraying the company in a favorable light and giving the impression of acting in accordance with social expectations. Although promotional by nature, the CEO letter also needs to incorporate language that suggests transparency, accountability, and a commitment to sustainability to maintain alignment with societal expectations.
