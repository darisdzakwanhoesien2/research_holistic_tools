robustness of our conclusions, we additionally account for the correlations between the factor variables and linguistic style and content variables⁷. We present our correlation analysis in Table IV.

Notably, we find that readability⁸ positively correlates with assertive and defensive styles but negatively correlates with the formal-analytical style. These results suggest that contrary to the obfuscation-through-low-readability hypothesis proposed in prior studies, more explicit rhetorical IM tends to rely on simpler, understandable language. Further, in acknowledging the diverse interpretations and classifications within the field of IM, it is important to note that the terms “assertive” and “defensive” encompass a broad spectrum of subcategories in the literature, including enhancements, entitlements, excuses and justifications (Tedeschi and Melburg, 1984). In our investigation, as indicated by correlations observed, the assertive category is notably associated with what might be considered enhancements, portraying an overly optimistic perspective, while the defensive category aligns more with justifications or the act of sensemaking and rationalizing the communicated content.

## 4.4. Empirical models

To test our hypotheses, we apply the following regression model:

Rhetorical style = f(INDsen, ESGcontro, INDsen X ESGcontr, controls)

The dependent variable allows for three different rhetorical styles. The first is represented by the analytical thinking variable, which loads highly negatively on the assertive and defensive factors in the factor analysis and stands for formal-analytical language use. This somewhat detached and impersonal rhetorical approach stresses logical and rational information structuring and low CEO interference to guide the audience to a preferred mindset. The other two dependent variables are derived from our factor analysis: an assertive style (Factor 1); and a defensive rhetorical approach (Factor 2). The latter two variables correspond to writing styles that are predominantly narrative and include storytelling and explicit IM elements (emotional, personal and cognitive language).

The first variable of interest (INDsen), being a dummy variable that indicates a company’s membership in sensitive industries, captures general visibility (H1 and H3). In defining the variable, we follow prior literature (Garcia et al., 2017; Passetti et al., 2018) and consider materials (including chemicals, metals &amp; mining, forestry-paper &amp; wood products), oil &amp; gas and utilities as sensitive industries (dummy variable is coded one for those industries)⁹. The second variable of interest (ESGcontro) is the ESG controversies score as a proxy for issue visibility (H2 and H3). The score is calculated by Refinitiv based on 23 ESG controversy topics and is captured from global media (third-party sourced information) that materially impact the corporations. The score allows comparison across industries and resolves the market cap bias, which large companies suffer from, as they attract more media attention than smaller companies through adjusting and normalizing scores based on company size and

⁷ Style variables are derived from LIWC-22; whereas content variables are based on the CSR dictionary developed by Pencle and Malaescu (2016), which encompasses dimensions related to employee, human rights, environment, and social and community.

⁸ FOG Readability Index is calculated as: -1 x 0.4 x (average words per sentence + percentage of complex words). In our study, higher FOG index values indicate more readable CEO letters.

⁹ We acknowledge that all companies in all industrial sectors can conduct activities with potential implications for the environment and society. Our selection of sustainability-sensitive industries includes the industries with the major socio-environmental impact, following prior literature.
