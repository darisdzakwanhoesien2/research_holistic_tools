maybe, perhaps) reflecting tentativeness, humble and anxious language (Kacewicz et al., 2014; Pennebaker et al., 2015). Finally, the emotional tone variable puts positive tone and negative tone dimensions into a single variable (Cohn et al., 2004). The higher the score, the more positive the tone is. Tone as a measure of text sentiment has been widely used as a proxy of disclosure balance in SR. Table I summarizes the indicators of analytical thinking, clout, and emotional tone, their directions and example words.

Cognitive processes is another composite variable that includes markers of cognitive complexity such as insight, causation, discrepancy, tentative, certitude and differentiation words. Cognitive processes words signal thought, causality and insight, and are used in situations, when people wish to transmit facts, reconstruct events and provide explanations for them (Brownlow et al., 2020, pp. 11-12). Sense-giving in accounting narratives largely depends on these linguistic devices (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). The composite variable is expressed as a percentage of the total words used in any given language sample. Table II presents components of the cognitive processes variable with their most frequently used exemplars.

## 4.3. Factor analysis

We use the LIWC-derived variables as inputs to factor analysis to identify salient linguistic structures in the CEO letters. We employ principal component factor analysis with varimax orthogonal rotation. The identified constructs serve further as our test variables. Table III shows the resulting variables and their respective factor loadings.

The analysis led to the identification of two uncorrelated factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, which cumulatively explain 72% of the overall variance. They group the stylistic and content characteristics that tend to co-occur in SR CEO letters, revealing the main explicit IM profiles in our sample. We use a cut-off of 0.20 for interpretation purposes and label the factors as follows: assertive (Factor 1) and defensive (Factor 2).

Both factors have negative loadings on analytic thinking. This provides strong support that analytic indicates a more formal and analytical style with minimal audience engagement, while identified factors represent highly narrative, less technical and less factual writing styles. Factor 1 is based on positive emotional tone and clout, highlighting social connections and accomplishments with the use of optimistic narratives, which we refer to as assertive. Factor 2 is balanced communication (e.g., neutral loading of emotional tone) with high use of cognitive processes markers that cautiously provide explanation and meaning to organizational outcomes, which we refer to as defensive. Within Factor 2, the loadings suggest that this style provides complex meanings, justifications and explanations for organizational events while avoiding strong emotional bias. To ensure accurate factor labeling and strengthen the
