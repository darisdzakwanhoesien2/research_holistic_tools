and the ESG practice of companies transparent, thus indirectly reducing the motivation of the management to greenwash the ESG report and reducing the risk of stock price crash.

## 4.4. Mediation mechanism test

Full disclosure of ESG information by companies can reduce information asymmetry between companies and stakeholders, thereby significantly reducing the stock price crash risk (da Silva, 2022; Murata &amp; Hamori, 2021); Conversely, the higher the degree of information asymmetry, the greater the stock price crash risk (Hutton et al., 2009; Jin &amp; Myers, 2006). If companies greenwash ESG reports in order to hide bad news or deliberately create good news, stakeholders will be difficult to identify (Li et al., 2022), resulting in an increase in the degree of information asymmetry, and causing the stock price crash after the bad news cannot be hidden.

Referring to the practice of Kim and Lim (2017), this paper uses the informed transaction probability (PIN) calculated by the EKO market microstructure model as an index to measure the degree of information asymmetry. The higher the probability of informed transaction, the greater the degree of information asymmetry. As shown in Table 8, ESG reporting greenwashing is significantly positively correlated with information asymmetry at the 5% level, indicating that ESG greenwashing increases the degree of information asymmetry between insiders (informed traders) and external investors (uninformed traders) of the company.
