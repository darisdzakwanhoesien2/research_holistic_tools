The mean difference of the t-test indicates that the stock price crash risk is significantly lower in the ESG non-greenwashing group than that in the ESG report greenwashing group, which suggests that the stock price crash risk is greater in ESG report greenwashing companies.

# 4.2. Basic regression results

In Table 3, Panel A shows the empirical result for panel mixed regression. The results (1) and (2) are full sample regression results, and the results (3) and (4) are subsample regression results. It can be seen that the dependent variables F.NCSKEW and F.DUVOL are significantly and positively correlated with Greenwashing at the  $5\%$  level in the whole sample regression; and the dependent variables F.NCSKEW and F.DUVOL are significantly and positively correlated with Greenwashing at the  $5\%$  and  $10\%$  levels, respectively, in the subsample. This paper also controls the firm's fixed effect to reduce endogenous. Because the fixed effect model requires great differences between samples, and there are many companies in the whole sample that have not issued ESG reports for many consecutive years whose greenwashing index are assigned to zero, so this paper uses sub-samples that do not include such companies to conduct the fixed effect regression test. Panel B is the test result, which is consistent with mixed regression. The regression result indicates that the of stock price crash risk is higher for companies that engage in ESG report greenwashing, and supports Barnea and Rubin's (2010) view on the masking effect of social responsibility information disclosure, which validates the hypothesis of this paper.
