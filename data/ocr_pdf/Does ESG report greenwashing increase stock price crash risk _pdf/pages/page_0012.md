(NCSKEW or DUVOL), monthly average excess turnover rate (DTURN), standard deviation of the return rate (Sigma), average return rate (Ret), return on assets (Roa), book-to-market ratio (Bm), leverage ratio (Lev), firm size (Size), institutional shareholding ratio (Institute), information transparency (ABACC) and ownership nature (SOE). In addition, we also control years (Year) and industries (Industry). The main variable definitions are provided in Table 1.

Following Kim et al. (2014), Cao and Zhang (2020), we construct model (2) to test our assumptions:

$$
C r a s h _ {i, t + 1} = a _ {0} + a _ {1} G r e e n w a s h i n g _ {i, t} + a _ {i} \sum C o n t r o l s _ {i, t} + \varepsilon_ {i, t} \tag {2}
$$

# 4.1. Descriptive statistics

In Table 2, Panel A presents descriptive statistics for the main variables of the whole sample. The mean value of NCSKEW is  $-0.401$  and the median value is  $-0.366$ , which is less than the median and shows a leftward deviation, while the mean value of DUVOL  $-0.280$  is slightly greater than the median value  $-0.290$ . The standard deviation of NCSKEW and DUVOL is  $0.776 / 0.490$ , respectively. These large standard deviations indicate that the two measures of stock price collapse risk of the sample companies in the sample variables vary significantly. We find that the mean value of greenwashing in the whole sample is only  $4.2\%$ , which is mainly due to the fact that companies with both ESG information data and
