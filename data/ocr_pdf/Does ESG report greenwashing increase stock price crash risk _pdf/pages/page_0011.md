The higher the value, the greater the degree of ESG report greenwashing. If the difference is positive, we can say there is a phenomenon of greenwashing in ESG information; otherwise, the company has not greenwashed ESG report. Among them, the ESG information disclosure rating provided by Bloomberg only reflects the amount of ESG data disclosed by the company to the public, but it does not measure company's ESG performance (Yu et al., 2020). The ESG performance rating provided by Thomson Reuters Eikon is often used to represent the company's real performance in terms of ESG (Rees &amp; Rodionova, 2015). Therefore, this measurement method is consistent with our definition of ESG report greenwashing, which can be used to accurately identify whether companies engage in greenwashing behaviours. In addition, the measurement requires that companies must have both ESG disclosure and performance scores. However, China does not mandate the disclosure of ESG information, the missing data for the large number of companies that do not disclose ESG information may affect the empirical conclusions. And according to our definition of ESG report greenwashing, failure to disclose ESG information also means that companies do not embellish their poor ESG performance through ESG reports, and the difference between standardised ESG disclosure and performance rating is 0. Therefore, the ESG report greenwashing index for this sample is assigned a value of 0. To make the empirical conclusion more significant, the 1,266 samples for which both ESG disclosure and performance data are available are treated as separate subsamples and subjected to an additional regression test.

Control variables: With reference to the studies of Kim et al. (2014), Cao and Zhang (2020), we control the following variables: the independent variable of the current period
