|  Authors | Theoretical Framework | Research Sample Characteristics | Characteristics of Strategic Approaches  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Martínez-Ferrero et al. [74] | Legitimacy theory, accountability theory | 273 firm-year observations representing 12 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA)2006-2014 | • Obfuscation disclosure strategy—providing low-quality CSR information that obscures actual performance; such information tends to be unbalanced, less accurate, and less clear, often overly optimistic, lengthy, and difficult to read.• Enhancement disclosure strategy—using high-quality CSR reporting to highlight positive organizational outcomes; offering information that is more reliable, transparent, and comparable.  |
|  Megura and Gunderson [75] | The concept of frame | Eight multinational corporations (3 coal companies and 5 oil and gas companies)2018-2019 | • Techno-optimism—the belief that innovative technologies and alternative fuels alone, without the need for broader social change, can solve climate change; typically emphasizes the benefits of proposed solutions while ignoring potential drawbacks.• Compliance—adherence to established regulations and standards, often highlighted to obscure past harms or ongoing issues, even when regulations are formally met.• Countermeasures—strategies that indirectly address harms by emphasizing positive contributions to society, diverting stakeholder attention from the industry's negative impacts and leading them to overlook the harm caused.• Omissions—certain relevant topics are either omitted or only briefly mentioned:- Risk minimization—downplaying the potential environmental and societal risks of fossil fuels.- Possibility blindness—ignoring potential future scenarios that diverge significantly from the assumption of a growing economy reliant on increased energy output.  |
|  Nguyen et al. [82] | Not stated | 597 Australian-listed companies (2316 company-year observations) included in the S&P ASX 300 (Australian Securities Exchange)2009-2018 | • Strategic ESG motivation—integrating sustainability initiatives into a company's overall strategic objectives.• Altruistic ESG motivation—undertaking actions aimed at advancing societal interests, even if they come at the expense of the company's own benefit.• Greenwashing ESG motivation—emphasizing ESG disclosures without meaningful engagement in substantive ESG activities.  |
