forensic techniques would enable researchers to capture modes of framing and narrative construction that are overlooked by text-only approaches. This comprehensive perspective can reveal subtler forms of impression management, assist companies in improving the coherence and transparency of report design, and provide regulators with more sophisticated tools to audit sustainability disclosures holistically.

Finally, developing predictive greenwashing models represents a critical step toward proactive oversight. By leveraging both linguistic and visual features, researchers can build labeled repositories of verified cases and train machine-learning classifiers to detect patterns that precede misconduct. Such models would offer academics new insights into the antecedents of greenwashing, provide regulators with data-driven risk scores to guide targeted inspections, and enable companies to use these tools for internal compliance monitoring.

From a theoretical standpoint, this study contributes to the consolidation of fragmented conceptualizations of greenwashing by linking them to broader discussions on organizational legitimacy, ethics, and corporate communication. Methodologically, it systematizes the existing tools for identifying greenwashing through content analysis and proposes a comprehensive agenda to advance both methodological rigor and theoretical depth. From a practical perspective, the findings provide actionable guidance for policymakers, sustainability officers, corporate managers, and board members responsible for ESG reporting and communication, helping them enhance the credibility of sustainability reporting. By emphasizing transparency, verifiability, and balanced disclosure, this study encourages organizations to move beyond symbolic compliance toward genuine accountability. Ultimately, this review reinforces the importance of integrating theoretical depth with methodological rigor to better understand, detect, and prevent greenwashing—thereby fostering more credible, trustworthy, and sustainable corporate communication practices.

Although this study offers valuable insights for scholars and practitioners, several limitations should be acknowledged. The systematic review relied exclusively on publications indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. While these databases are widely regarded as authoritative sources and are commonly used for literature reviews and bibliometric analyses, this choice may have excluded relevant publications on greenwashing strategies and content-based measurement approaches indexed in other databases (e.g. Google Scholar or EBSCO). Additionally, non-English publications were omitted, which may have limited the diversity of perspectives included in this review. However, incorporating articles in languages other than English would have significantly increased the time and resources required due to translation needs. Given that most reputable, indexed journals publish primarily in English, this trade-off was considered acceptable. The findings are also influenced by the chosen search terms; alternative keyword combinations might yield different results, particularly given the variety of expressions related to “greenwashing” and “sustainability reporting”. However, the selection of search terms was guided by a comprehensive review of prior studies, and Boolean operators were applied to broaden the search strategy. We also undertook extensive reference screening to identify relevant work that might not emerge through keyword-based searches. Although search-term bias cannot be entirely eliminated, these procedures substantially mitigate its effects in our review. Furthermore, while content analysis inevitably entails some degree of subjectivity, this risk was mitigated through independent coding by two researchers.

Despite these constraints, this study provides a structured and integrative synthesis of existing knowledge on greenwashing in sustainability reporting and identifies promising avenues for future theoretical development and empirical exploration.
