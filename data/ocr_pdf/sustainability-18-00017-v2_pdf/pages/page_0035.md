|  Authors | Theoretical Framework | Research Sample Characteristics | Characteristics of Strategic Approaches  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Hejlova et al. [77] | Not stated | • Sustainability reports and annual reports from 69 signatories to the UN Global Compact's Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action 2022–2023 | • Strategic silence on deadstock/overstock—minimal or absent disclosure of strategies for managing or reducing overproduction, with such vagueness recognized as a sign of greenwashing.  |
|  Khan et al. [66] | Institutional theory | • 21 semi-structured interviews with executives of 18 banks in Bangladesh and published sources 2011–2014 | • Acquiescence strategy—adoption of CSR practices driven by alignment between firm goals and institutional expectations, motivated primarily by the need to maintain social legitimacy. • Compromise strategy—implementation of CSR practices that balance full compliance with regulations and more flexible approaches, including negotiation and engagement, ranging from superficial compliance to direct confrontation. • Avoidance strategy—treating CSR responses to institutional pressures not merely as compliance issues but as strategic opportunities to meet the expectations of powerful stakeholders, often at the expense of weaker ones; employing decoupling tactics and concealed practices to circumvent CSR regulations. • Defiance strategy—defying CSR regulations. • Manipulation strategy—adopting CSR practices as an active means to influence and reshape institutional pressures.  |
|  Kurpierz and Smith [64] | Agency theory | • Literature review | • Fraudulent (greenwashing)—claims that are unsupported by factual evidence, resulting in harm due to material misstatement. • “Cheap talk” (greenwashing)—claims that lack factual support but do not result in harm. • Responsible firms—claims that are factually accurate, though firms may remain silent on negative environmental performance due to voluntary disclosure regimes. • Vocal green firms—firms that report accurately and actively engage in environmental sustainability initiatives.  |
