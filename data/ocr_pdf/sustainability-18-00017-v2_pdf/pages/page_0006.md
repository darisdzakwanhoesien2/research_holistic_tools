in coding between the two researchers were resolved through discussion, and any agreed refinements of the coding scheme were applied consistently across all publications.

Figure 2 presents the quantitative descriptive characteristics of the analyzed publications, while the following section reports the results of the qualitative content analysis for the two thematic groups. Detailed characteristics of the studies included in the SLR are provided in Table A4 and Table A5 in the Appendix A. It should be noted that some publications addressed both thematic areas (i.e. they proposed a strategic typology and, at the same time, developed or applied a content-analysis-based measurement approach).

In addition, to evaluate the methodological quality and transparency of the review process, the PRISMA 2020 checklist was completed, and compliance with its 27 reporting items was verified (Table S1 in the Supplementary Material).

## 3. Results and Discussion

This section presents the main findings of the SLR on greenwashing in sustainability reporting. It synthesizes key strategic typologies, content-analysis--based measurement approaches, and analytical techniques used to identify greenwashing. By integrating theoretical, methodological, and empirical insights, the section elucidates how greenwashing has been conceptualized, operationalized, and evidenced across the extant literature.

### 3.1. Strategic Typologies of Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting

Research on strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting primarily draws on legitimacy theory, impression management theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory.

Most existing typologies are structured around a four-quadrant matrix but differ in the dimensions considered. Amores-Salvadó et al. [63] developed a model of four distinct strategic positions by comparing environmental performance and disclosure relative to industry averages. They identify two coherent approaches—green leaders and blackbirds—and two incoherent ones: green quiets (representing brownwashing) and green parrots (indicative of greenwashing). Kurpierz and Smith [64] refined Delmas and Burbano's [3] greenwashing typology by focusing on the truthfulness of claims (true/false) and their consequences (harm/no harm), thereby deconstructing greenwashing into a harm/no-harm dichotomy that differentiates between fraudulent practices and “cheap talk.” Cooper and Wang [65] analyzed the relationship between reported policy and activities addressing refugee needs. They categorized corporations into four types—reactionary,
