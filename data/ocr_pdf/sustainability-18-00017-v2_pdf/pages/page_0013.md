content analysis of sustainability reports is used to identify the nature of corporate sustainability activities, classify them as symbolic or substantive, and assess the potential imbalance between these two dimensions in sustainability reporting. From this perspective, greenwashing is operationalized as a predominance of symbolic content over substantive information [101,102,103]. However, it should be emphasized that symbolic communication should not, in all contexts, be treated as synonymous with greenwashing. It constitutes greenwashing only when it systematically substitutes for or obscures substantive information, rather than when it coexists with reliable, performance-based disclosure [6,30,103,104].

Symbolic actions (often referred to as green talk) occur when a company makes claims or discloses information about social or environmental initiatives that are not actually implemented in practice [24]. Such symbolic disclosures tend to be broad, predominantly positive, and typically lack measurable evidence or verifiable outcomes. In contrast, substantive actions (green walk) refer to disclosures describing initiatives that have been materially implemented and have produced tangible, verifiable impacts. In other words, whenever a company provides detailed and evidence-based information about a specific action, or when the accuracy of its claims can be verified, the disclosure is considered substantive [24].

Although the symbolic--substantive distinction is the most widely used conceptualization in the literature, several authors employ alternative terminology to describe comparable phenomena. For example, Khan et al. [104] differentiate between cosmetic and organic efforts, where cosmetic efforts rely on rhetorical strategies and attention-grabbing narratives that superficially frame positive environmental performance, whereas organic actions reflect credible and meaningful initiatives supported by concrete evidence. Xing et al. [102] distinguish between soft and hard sustainability disclosures, with soft disclosures referring to claims without strong objective evidence, typically compiled by companies themselves, and hard disclosures based on quantitative data that can be verified by other institutions. Despite the different terminology, these studies share a common assumption: symbolic communication reflects declarative or aspirational expressions of commitment, while substantive actions provide verifiable evidence of actual progress towards sustainability.

Our SLR revealed that most authors applied checklist-based classification schemes to distinguish between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions. This method relies on predefined lists of sustainability-related issues or actions, where each disclosed item is coded as symbolic or substantive depending on its level of detail, quantification, and verifiability. For example, Xing et al. [102] developed a checklist consisting of 16 soft and 79 hard disclosure items, representing narrative versus evidence-based information. Khan et al. [104] constructed a checklist of 14 items assessing the reliability (organic actions) and relevance (cosmetic actions) of information presented in sustainability reports. Li et al. [101] identified 8 elements characterizing symbolic actions and 6 describing substantive ones. Van der Ploeg and Vanclay [6] employed a ten-question checklist to assess whether reports provided balanced information, including negative environmental impacts, arguing that a high proportion of descriptive over data-supported disclosures indicates potential symbolic legitimation strategies. Zhang et al. [105] proposed a checklist of 19 environmental disclosure items, specifying criteria for classifying each disclosure or corporate activity as symbolic or substantive. Subsequently, Zhang et al. [106] expanded this framework to 22 indicators, while Zhang et al. [107] further incorporated additional evidence such as certifications and quantified environmental achievements. Similarly, Xu et al. [103] applied a 17-item checklist addressing the readability, reliability, and completeness of sustainability disclosures, defining explicit criteria for categorizing statements as symbolic or substantive.

A slightly different approach to classifying corporate sustainability actions as symbolic or substantive was proposed by Costa et al. [108]. The authors employed the Global
