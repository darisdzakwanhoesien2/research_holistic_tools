recurring, relevant, and revelatory—based on the consistency of refugee programming over time and the degree of alignment between programs, policies, and impacts.

In another approach, strategic responses to institutional influences in sustainability reporting have been classified along a continuum from passive to active. Acquiescence represents the most passive strategy, manipulation the most active, while compromise, avoidance, and defiance fall in between [66].

Various typologies are derived from impression management theory. Talbot and Barbat [67] identified four impression management strategies in mining companies' CSR reports aimed at neutralizing and obscuring negative information on water performance. These include two data manipulation strategies—strategic omission and obfuscation—used to conceal noncompliance and poor performance, and two defensive strategies—minimizing environmental impact and relativizing poor environmental performance—employed to legitimize negative aspects. Leung and Snell [68] found that gambling companies use five camouflaging-based disclosure strategies—zero disclosure, curtailment, disclamation, defensive façades, and assertive façades—involving impression management to selectively maintain moral legitimacy amid shifting institutional expectations. Drawing on an analysis of communication strategies employed by Spanish listed companies regarding the SDGs, García-Sánchez et al. [69] revealed the use of legitimization strategy alongside proactive and defensive impression management approaches. The proactive approach focused on congratulation, self-promotion, and organizational promotion, while the defensive approach addressed negative situations through excuses, justifications, and apologies.

In the context of signaling theory and legitimization strategies, Hahn and Lülfs [70], drawing on the concepts of symbolic and substantive management of legitimacy, identified six specific strategies for disclosing negative aspects in sustainability reports: marginalization, abstraction, indication of facts, rationalization (instrumental and theoretical), authorization, and corrective action (type 1 and type 2). Saber and Weber [71] subsequently applied the same framework and typology. Yuan et al. [72] identified three distinct greenwashing strategies: exaggerating, referring to the gap between actual performance and disclosure; distracting, highlighting the gap between strengths and concerns; and window-dressing, addressing the gap between materiality and immateriality. Leung and Snell [73] further revealed that companies in controversial industries, such as gambling, often engage in symbolic manipulation rather than substantive CSR, aiming to alter perceptions of corporate identity by emphasizing pragmatic legitimacy, diverting attention from moral legitimacy issues, and manipulating cognitive symbols. Finally, Martínez-Ferrero et al. [74] found that companies with superior CSR performance tend to use high-quality CSR reporting to highlight achievements (enhancement strategy), offering more comparable and reliable information. In contrast, companies with poorer CSR performance often employ low-quality reporting to obscure actual performance (obfuscation strategy), providing information that is less balanced, accurate, and clear.

While some researchers emphasize the exaggerated optimism in sustainability communications, others focus on the defensive strategies employed by companies. Laskin and Mikhailovna Nesova [26] demonstrated that sustainability reports are characterized by pronounced optimism, as they employ a higher frequency of positively charged linguistic elements—such as praise, satisfaction, and inspiration—while reducing the use of negatively charged expressions such as blame, hardship, and denial. Megura and Gunderson [75] identified subtle forms of climate change denial in the sustainability reports of fossil fuel companies, manifested as ideological denialism, greenwashing, and reification. Moreover, they observed various forms of greenwashing used to manipulate stakeholder perceptions within climate-related narratives, including techno-optimism, compliance,
