Table 5. Avenues for Advancing Research on Strategic Typologies and Measurement Approaches for Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting.

|  Identified Research Gap | Research Questions | Suggested Research Approach  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Avenue 1: Advancing understanding of strategic typologies and positions of greenwashing in sustainability reporting  |   |   |
|  Limited understanding of heterogeneous greenwashing strategies in sustainability reporting | How do companies combine, balance, or decouple symbolic and substantive sustainability actions, and what reporting strategies distinguish genuine engagement from façade-based communication? | Text-action alignment analysis; supervised typology classification; case-based process tracing; longitudinal mixed-methods design  |
|  Connecting sustainability reporting approaches with internal decision-making rules | How do boundary decisions, legal considerations, and assurance scope influence specific reporting approaches, and which actors drive each stage of report development? | Semi-structured interviews; audits of governance KPIs and assurance workpapers; process tracing linking internal dashboards to report edits; tactic-to-signal coding dictionary  |
|  Limited understanding of greenhushing in sustainability reporting | Under what conditions do companies choose silence over spin, which topics are systematically omitted, and how do these omissions relate to liability risk or organizational capability constraints? | Two-wave anonymous manager surveys; internal-external KPI gap analysis; missing-data analysis and peer-benchmark detection; case studies in controversial industries  |
|  Limited evidence on greenwashing practices in sustainability reporting among SMEs and companies in emerging markets | How do organizational capability constraints and institutional pressures influence the selection of reporting tactics in companies beyond large publicly listed companies? | Multi-country SME sampling; semi-structured interviews with context-aware content analysis; moderator tests for ownership and enforcement intensity  |
|  Limited understanding of the causal effects of external assurance on corporate greenwashing approaches and strategies in sustainability reporting | Does transitioning from limited to reasonable assurance reduce the use of specific strategic reporting approaches? | Difference-in-differences analysis leveraging assurance upgrades; blind re-audits on stratified samples; structured auditor checklists as primary data sources; preregistered coding of reporting tactics  |
|  Scarce exploration of AI's role in amplifying and detecting corporate greenwashing approaches and strategies in sustainability reporting | Does LLM-assisted sustainability report drafting contribute to greater linguistic homogeneity or tone bias, and can hybrid human-AI pipelines reliably detect such approaches? | Stylometric/authorship-signal analysis; LLM-assisted annotation with human adjudication; transparent model cards; Inter-rater reliability reporting and pre-registration  |
|  Avenue 2: Advancing research on disclosure-performance gaps to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting  |   |   |
|  Limited understanding of how ESG performance measurement choices and time-lag structures influence disclosure-performance greenwashing assessments | Under what conditions do alternative ESG performance metrics (registry-based, rating-based, or content-analysis-derived) and talk-to-walk lag specifications lead to materially different disclosure-performance greenwashing assessments? | Triangulated ESG performance datasets; distributed-lag specifications  |
|  Scarce evidence on cross-pillar comparability in disclosure-performance greenwashing metrics | How consistent are disclosure-performance gaps across ESG pillars, and what contextual factors moderate observed decoupling? | Pillar-level gap decomposition using multi-block PLS; multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM)  |
|  Insufficient research on the effectiveness of regulatory and audit mechanisms in reducing disclosure-performance greenwashing | Do changes in mandatory ESG reporting and assurance regimes materially reduce disclosure-performance gaps, and through which enforcement mechanisms? | Difference-in-differences analysis using regulatory shocks (e.g., NFRD/TCFD adoption)  |
|  Limited evidence on the validity and generalizability of text-based ESG disclosure measurement techniques | Which NLP pipelines (dictionary-based, topic modeling, or transformer-based) provide the most reliable and explainable estimates of disclosure-performance decoupling across sectors and time? | Construction of a benchmark ESG corpus with verified performance outcomes; cross-model validation (lexicon/LDA/transformers)  |
|  Avenue 3: Deepening research on symbolic and substantive ESG disclosure in detecting greenwashing  |   |   |
|  Limited consistency in operationalizing symbolic versus substantive sustainability disclosures | Under what conditions do symbolic and substantive disclosure classifications remain stable across codebooks, languages, and industry contexts? | Development of unified codebook; multilingual NLP applications; measurement-invariance testing; cross-country replication exercises  |
|  Limited understanding of stakeholder-specific perceptions of symbolic versus substantive disclosure | Do different stakeholder groups (investors, NGOs, consumers, and regulators) systematically differ in identifying symbolic versus substantive ESG claims? | Stakeholder experiments; conjoint analysis; behavioral designs  |
