to assess disclosure precision, with financial data considered the most credible form of evidence [1]. Some studies have used advanced natural language processing techniques to quantify ESG disclosures, combining content extraction with sentiment analysis [87,91,92,93,94].

Beyond quantitative text metrics or sentiment indicators, several studies operationalized disclosure through checklist-based assessments, identifying the presence or absence of specific sustainability elements, typically coded in binary form [11,85,89,90,95,96]. In addition, environmental disclosure has also been quantified using self-reported environmental data submitted to external registries, treating reported quantities as indicators of environmental transparency [7,100].

In the reviewed studies, sustainability performance was most frequently quantified using external ESG scores provided by established global financial and non-financial data vendors, including Bloomberg [1,85,91], Refinitiv (now LSEG Data) [23], MSCI KLD STAT [11,93], CNRDS [88,92], HEXUN-RKS [90,94] and KOSPI200 [86]. Lagasio [87] also employed a normalized ESG score to assess greenwashing, although the data source for this metric was not explicitly specified. In several studies, environmental performance indicators were obtained directly from external operational data registries, most commonly from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported to regulatory authorities and environmental agencies [7,89,100].

In the remaining group of studies, ESG performance was derived through content analysis of sustainability reports. These studies constructed checklist-based assessments of indicators aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework or specific ESG actions. Quantitatively verified practices were distinguished from qualitative descriptions, with greater weight assigned to evidence supported by measurable or verifiable data [84,95,96,97,98,99].

An overview of methods used to operationalize ESG disclosures and performances is presented in Table 2.

In the analyzed studies, greenwashing is primarily conceptualized as the discrepancy between companies' communicated sustainability claims and their actual sustainability performance. Accordingly, empirical measurement typically relies on discrepancy-based indicators, expressed either as the difference between ESG disclosure levels and ESG performance levels [1,88,90] or as the ratio of disclosed ESG items to implemented sustainability actions [23].

More advanced studies develop customized indicators that integrate cognitive and linguistic dimensions of sustainability communication. For instance, Kim et al. [86] define greenwashing as the difference between text-weighted ESG disclosure scores—which capture the depth and materiality of sustainability language—and ESG performance. Kim and Lyon [7] measure greenwashing as the deviation between declared and actual emission reductions, normalized by declared reduction levels to control for firm-size effects. Similarly, Lagasio [87] constructs an “ESG-washing” metric by subtracting standardized sustainability performance scores from sentiment-based ESG disclosure indices. Lee and Raschke [23] compute the ratio of textual ESG performance communication to standardized Refinitiv ESG scores to capture the communicative exaggeration of performance. Li et al. [96] likewise calculate greenwashing as the discrepancy between standardized indices of green communication (GCI) and green practices (GPI), reflecting overstated communication relative to actual initiatives. Finally, Zhou and Chen [97] and Zhou et al. [98,99] operationalize greenwashing as the standardized disparity between weighted textual disclosure indices and quantified environmental performance indicators, offering a multidimensional representation of disclosure--performance misalignment.
