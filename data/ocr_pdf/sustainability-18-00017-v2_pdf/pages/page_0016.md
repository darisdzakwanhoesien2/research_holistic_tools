disclosure and symbolic claims but are difficult to scale. Linguistic and NLP-based methods capture rhetorical cues such as tone, readability, and narrative patterns, though their accuracy depends on model quality and may produce results that diverge from checklist-based evaluations. Consequently, the literature increasingly views these methods as complementary: measuring both what is disclosed and how it is disclosed provides distinct yet mutually reinforcing insights into the multidimensional nature of greenwashing.

### 3.3.1. Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Through Tone Analysis

An expanding line of research examines how the tone of sustainability reporting—captured through linguistic and sentiment cues—functions as a proxy for detecting greenwashing.

Based on Diction 6.0, Fisher et al. [119] analyzed six forms of tone—positivity, activity, optimism, certainty, realism, and commonality—as potential measures of obfuscation in corporate narratives. However, they found no evidence that tone was used for obfuscation; instead, they observed the opposite effect. In contrast, Esterhuyse and du Toit [120] examined narrative tones (certainty, optimism, activity, realism, and commonality) in large multinationals' human rights disclosures using Diction 7.1.3. They found that low-disclosure companies disproportionately relied on an optimistic tone—particularly using terms denoting satisfaction and inspiration—thereby signaling assertive impression management strategies. Drawing on the AFINN dictionary for word-level sentiment classification, García-Sánchez [69] also identified the use of impression-management practices in sustainability communication strategies.

Adopting a slightly different approach, Zharfpeykan [110] assessed Australian companies' environmental and social disclosures, ranging from omission to fully quantified reporting of positive, negative, or neutral news, including violation-versus non-violation-related information. The study found that companies tended either to report representatively (balancing favorable and unfavorable items) or to engage in greenwashing by downplaying high-impact negatives while emphasizing less relevant positives. Using standard natural-language processing techniques, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] applied supervised sentiment analysis (positive/neutral/negative) to examine how a CSR report's environmental score—defined as a text-based measure of environmental emphasis—relates to positivity metrics, thereby evaluating two greenwashing mechanisms: decoupling and attention deflection. Martínez-Ferrero et al. [74] further demonstrated that companies with the worst CSR performance, when using an obfuscation-based disclosure strategy, provide less balanced reports that emphasize overly optimistic content. In addition, Conrad and Holtbrügge [121] showed that decoupling companies use fewer emotional references, more self-references, and fewer mentions of risk and anxiety, while relying more heavily on masculine-coded language.

Some studies restrict their analysis to counts of positive and negative words, thereby suggesting that an overly optimistic tone may indicate greenwashing [122]. Building on Huang et al. [123], Hamza and Jarboui [124] employed a more elaborate method, assessing tone management in French companies' sustainability reports by counting positive and negative terms using the French version of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionary. They decomposed tone into a normal component, reflecting neutral descriptions, and an abnormal component, indicating the strategic use of tone management to inform or mislead stakeholders. Liao et al. [125] adopted a similar approach, analyzing the net positive tone of ESG reports (based on positive and negative dictionary of Tsinghua University) by Chinese listed companies and arguing that companies that “talk more and work less” engage in tone management—i.e. greenwashing. Liang and Wu [126] also applied this approach, using the “Bag of Words” method and textual analysis of CSR reports from Chinese listed
