4. Directions for Future Research

Our SLR reveals significant research gaps and unresolved questions that can guide future investigations. While previous studies have provided valuable insights, several areas remain underexplored and warrant more rigorous scholarly attention.

Overall, adopting a mixed-methods approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative techniques is crucial. It enhances methodological rigor, captures the multifaceted nature of greenwashing analysis, and addresses the lack of qualitative depth inherent in purely quantitative designs.

The analyzed studies indicate that companies may adopt diverse—and often mixed—greenwashing strategies in sustainability reporting, ranging from purely symbolic to substantive actions, or combinations of both. However, existing research frequently over-simplifies these practices, limiting our understanding of how greenwashing manifests across different strategic approaches [10]. Future studies should address this gap by systematically aligning narrative disclosures with verified performance metrics using supervised machine-learning methods, and by employing longitudinal or case-based designs to trace strategic combinations, shifts, and manipulative practices over time. Despite substantial progress in conceptualizing strategic typologies of greenwashing—ranging from distinctions between symbolic and substantive legitimacy management [70] to impression-management frameworks such as enhancement and obfuscation [80,81] or deceptive manipulation [12]—the literature continues to focus predominantly on observable communications and reporting artifacts. It pays less attention to internal organizational processes that generate them. Much of the current understanding derives from textual, visual, or case-based inferences [26,67,74], making it difficult to link specific communicative approaches to concrete decision-making rules within companies. Future research should therefore combine primary data, governance documents, and assurance workpapers to trace how corporate “talk” is generated, by whom, and for what purposes. It should also aim to develop validated tactic-to-signal dictionaries that connect internal routines with external reporting outcomes. Another notable gap concerns the under-measurement of silence. While existing typologies richly describe what companies disclose—for example, camouflaging strategies in controversial industries [68,73]—they are less effective at identifying greenhushing, or strategic nondisclosure, which often escapes text-based analyses. Studies documenting defensive legitimation and denial frames [75,76] suggest that the boundary between selective speech and deliberate silence is blurred; yet, systematic measures of omission remain scarce. Future research should therefore model disclosure decisions at the margin—examining what is omitted and why—by combining anonymous managerial surveys with gap analyses between internal practices and external reporting. Existing research predominantly focuses on listed companies in developed markets, often within single industries or national contexts [67,68,73], whereas evidence on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies in emerging economies remains limited. Strategic frameworks explicitly distinguish between “talk” and “walk” [10] or classify disclosure--performance consistency [63,64,65], highlighting substantial heterogeneity across organizational and institutional contexts. Comparative research designs should therefore investigate how specific constraints—such as reporting costs, liability risk, and supply-chain opacity—influence the selection of disclosure tactics, particularly in sectors where hidden trade-offs are most prevalent. In addition, causal evidence regarding the mechanisms that effectively curb greenwashing remains limited. The existing literature often posits that assurance or regulatory pressure can discipline reporting practices [72]; however, robust empirical tests—particularly those distinguishing between limited and reasonable assurance, or between in-scope and out-of-scope emissions—remain scarce. This includes investigating how greenwashing practices and stakeholder perceptions evolve over time
