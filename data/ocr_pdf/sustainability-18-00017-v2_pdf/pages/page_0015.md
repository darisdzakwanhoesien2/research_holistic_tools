# 3.2.3. Selective and Manipulative Disclosure Approach

A third approach to measuring greenwashing in sustainability reporting focuses on how companies present ESG-related information. Within this research stream, greenwashing is operationalized through the detection of selective disclosures and expressive manipulation of the content of sustainability reports. Selective disclosure is defined as a company intentionally emphasizing positive ESG achievements while omitting or downplaying negative aspects of its operations [109-114]. Expressive manipulation, on the other hand, involves using a promotional tone, emotional language, or biased narrative to influence stakeholder perceptions and create a favorable, yet potentially misleading, impression of the company's actual ESG activities and performance [111,112].

Our SLR revealed that selective disclosure and expressive manipulation were most commonly identified using checklist-based manual coding, in which ESG topics were classified as disclosed or omitted and further distinguished as symbolic or substantive. In these studies, selective disclosure was typically measured as the proportion of omitted ESG items relative to the total number of expected disclosures, while expressive manipulation was quantified as the ratio of symbolically disclosed items to all disclosed items [106,107] or as the ratio of symbolic to substantive disclosure elements [115]. The overall greenwashing level was often computed as the geometric mean of the selective disclosure and expressive manipulation levels [115-117].

Other researchers applied rubric-based coding frameworks, using author-designed diagnostic questions [109] or custom indicators [118] specifically developed to detect narrative exaggeration, unverifiable claims, and selective omission of sustainability information.

Another method for detecting greenwashing applies GRI-indicator-based manual coding, in which disclosures are classified as "good news," "neutral news," or "bad news," and companies are subsequently evaluated on whether they systematically downplay or omit unfavorable information while emphasizing positive disclosures [110].

Selective disclosure and expressive manipulation have also been examined using linguistic-textual methods. These methods relied on keyword frequency analysis and sentiment analysis to detect inflated positive language and patterns of symbolic communication [112,113]. They also combined lexicon-based techniques with stylistic and syntactic coding to capture narrative tone and discursive bias [111]. Finally, Yu et al. [114] applied a computational similarity-based method, demonstrating that templated sustainability statements with high textual similarity scores indicate generic and repetitive disclosure practices intended to obscure substantive performance.

An overview of methods used for operationalizing greenwashing in sustainability reporting based on selective and manipulative disclosure is presented in Table 4.

In summary, selective and manipulative measurement approaches share a common conceptualization of greenwashing—emphasizing positive information while omitting negative information—but differ in how they quantify the phenomenon and in their sensitivity to detecting it. Checklist-based methods offer transparent assessments of selective
