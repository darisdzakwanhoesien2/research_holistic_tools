study's objectives and determine eligibility for further analysis and data extraction. Each researcher independently screened all 274 publications to evaluate whether greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting constituted the primary focus of the article. They also assessed whether the study involved an empirical examination of greenwashing in corporate reporting in line with the predefined scope of the review. Based on these criteria, each publication was classified as either “include” or “exclude.” In cases where a researcher—after reviewing the title, keywords, and abstract—was uncertain about whether a publication met the inclusion criteria, it was conservatively classified as “include” and was retained for full-text assessment in the next stage. To evaluate inter-rater (inter-coder) reliability for the binary inclusion/exclusion decision, the reviewers' assessments were compared and Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient was high (κ = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78--0.91), indicating strong agreement between the two reviewers [59,60]. In cases where discrepancies between the researchers' decisions occurred, the publication was retained for full-text review in the next stage. As a result of this phase, 182 publications were retained for the research sample, while 92 were excluded as not relevant to the review's objectives. Full texts were subsequently retrieved for the 182 included studies. Only 4 publications could not be obtained. Additionally, 21 publications were identified through the snowballing method.

In the next stage, 178 publications identified through database searches and 21 additional publications identified via snowball sampling were subjected to in-depth full-text analysis. The same two researchers independently reviewed the full texts, applying inclusion criteria derived directly from the research questions: (1) the article discussed greenwashing strategies in the context of sustainability reporting as a central topic, or (2) the study presented and empirically applied at least one content-analysis-based approach to measuring greenwashing. Publications were excluded if greenwashing strategies or measurement approaches were addressed only tangentially, if no methods or approaches based on content analysis of sustainability reports or other ESG-related disclosures were presented or applied, or if all dimensions of greenwashing were operationalized exclusively through external ESG scores from global financial or non-financial data vendors. Inter-coder decisions were again compared, and Cohen's kappa was recalculated. Agreement for full-text eligibility reached 88% (95% CI: 0.81--0.95), indicating an almost perfect level of agreement [59,60]. In cases of disagreement, both researchers re-examined the publication, discussed their assessments, and reached a joint decision. Following this process, 88 publications were retained for further analysis (76 identified through database searches and 12 identified via snowball sampling).

To provide a clearer understanding of the process of searching and including publications in this review, the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.

In the final step of the SLR, a thematic content analysis was conducted to extract and synthesize data relevant to the research questions. A narrative synthesis approach was applied, combining systematic textual summarization with interpretive analysis of the findings, as appropriate given the objectives of this review [61,62]. Two researchers independently reviewed and coded the full texts of all publications to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. A combined deductive--inductive coding strategy was used. At the deductive level, the coding framework was structured around two main thematic groups of studies, corresponding to the research questions: (1) articles addressing strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and (2) articles presenting and applying content-analysis-based approaches and analytical techniques for measuring greenwashing.

Within each thematic group, additional codes were developed inductively to capture recurring concepts and patterns emerging from the material. For studies classified in the first group (strategic typologies), we coded the following elements: authorship,
