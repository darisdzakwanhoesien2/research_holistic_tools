and across regulatory contexts. The field would benefit from applying quasi-experimental designs such as difference-in-differences or interrupted time-series approaches, leveraging changes in assurance coverage or regulatory adoption. These should be combined with hybrid human--large language model (LLM) coding frameworks capable of capturing both linguistic and visual dimensions of disclosure tactics. The growing use of LLM-assisted writing introduces both risks and opportunities. Generative tools may homogenize tone, amplify optimism bias in corporate sustainability discourse [26], and reinforce identity-management effects [73]. Conversely, when coupled with transparent codebooks, human adjudication, and validation against objective outcomes, these tools can also enhance the detection of greenwashing. Advancing from proxy-based measures to ground-truth evidence will require the creation of labeled repositories containing report excerpts, graphics, and internal artifacts. Such datasets would enable predictive tests linking specific reporting approaches to subsequent organizational or environmental outcomes.

Recent studies increasingly measure greenwashing through content analysis by examining discrepancies between corporate sustainability disclosures and actual ESG performance. However, empirical evidence indicates that estimates of greenwashing vary substantially depending on the data source used for performance evaluation and the assumed time lag between disclosure and realized outcomes [84,89]. Future research should employ distributed lag models and integrate multiple independent sources of ESG performance data to enhance the reliability and validity of greenwashing assessments. Moreover, existing research has predominantly focused on the environmental pillar, providing limited insight into greenwashing within the social and governance dimensions. It is therefore essential to examine the consistency of disclosure--performance gaps across all ESG pillars and to explore contextual moderators that may influence such decoupling [1,88]. Another promising but underexplored avenue concerns the regulatory effectiveness and auditability of disclosure--performance gap metrics [87]. Future research should investigate whether the introduction or strengthening of disclosure obligations reduces these gaps and which ESG components are most responsive. Moreover, many studies rely on unvalidated coding schemes or subjective classifications methods, raising concerns regarding the construct validity and replicability of greenwashing indicators derived from content analysis. More systematic validation procedures, coupled with the increased application of natural language processing and AI-based techniques, are needed to improve the methodological rigor of future analyses [86,95].

The symbolic--substantive approach to measure greenwashing also faces several limitations that warrant further research. One major challenge concerns the lack of consistency in how symbolic and substantive disclosures are operationalized. Existing studies employ divergent classification rules, which may yield inconsistent conclusions depending on the coding schemes, linguistic contexts, and sectoral characteristics applied [6,24]. Future research should prioritize the development of unified coding frameworks, assess their cross-contextual stability, and validate them across multilingual corpora and industry segments using measurement-invariance techniques.

Another underexplored area involves the role of stakeholder perceptions in mediating the classification of symbolic versus substantive ESG claims. Current studies often assume homogeneous interpretive frameworks, overlooking how investors, NGOs, regulators, or consumers may differentially interpret identical disclosures [103,107]. Behavioral experiments and stakeholder-centered conjoint analyses could provide valuable insights into these perception gaps. Institutional and internationalization dynamics also warrant deeper examination. Current research provides limited evidence on how a company's degree of internationalization and institutional context influence the symbolic or substantive nature of ESG communication [101,104]. Future research could explore how external pressure and
