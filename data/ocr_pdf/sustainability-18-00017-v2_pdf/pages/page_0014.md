Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework to identify and categorize disclosure indicators. Based on these standards, they developed a checklist of GRI indicators and subsequently evaluated each disclosure item in sustainability reports to determine whether it was presented in a narrative (symbolic) form or as verifiable quantitative or performance-based (substantive) information.

In several studies, a linguistic-textual classification was applied to distinguish between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions. For example, Khalil and O'Sullivan [24] differentiated between the two by examining the linguistic structure of ESG narratives, including the number of sentences and words related to environmental and social topics, under the assumption that a higher proportion of symbolic expressions indicates a greater likelihood of greenwashing. Similarly, Huq and Carling [30] utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify the number of substantive greenhouse gas (GHG) disclosures included in sustainability reports, interpreting a low proportion of evidence-based statements as indicative of symbolic reporting and potential greenwashing.

An overview of methods used for operationalizing greenwashing in sustainability reporting based on symbolic and substantive dimensions is presented in Table 3.

Our analysis indicates that, within this group of studies, greenwashing was most frequently quantified as the discrepancy between symbolic and substantive sustainability disclosures [101,102,105,108] or as the ratio of symbolic to substantive elements in sustainability reporting [103,106,107]. Some researchers examined this phenomenon indirectly through disclosure quality indicators, where a greater emphasis on relevance (cosmetic efforts) relative to reliability (organic efforts) was interpreted as indicative of symbolic reporting and potential greenwashing [104]. Other studies identified greenwashing through the dominance of symbolic disclosures over substantive ones [24,30], or by observing a prevalence of declarative statements (symbolic actions) over verifiable data (substantive actions) [6]. Collectively, these findings suggest that symbolic sustainability communication not supported by verifiable progress may serve as a deliberate impression management strategy, representing greenwashing in corporate sustainability reporting.

Although all methods aim to detect the gap between symbolic and substantive disclosures, they operationalize this gap differently. Manual approaches provide detailed, context-sensitive assessments but are highly time- and resource-intensive. Automated methods (e.g., NLP, text mining) enable large-scale analysis and efficient analysis but may overlook subtle linguistic and contextual nuances. These approaches are therefore best seen as complementary: manual coding can be used to train and validate automated tools, thereby combining interpretive accuracy with computational scale. The optimal method ultimately depends on research objectives and resource constraints—automated techniques are well suited for large cross-sectional studies, whereas manual checklists are preferable for in-depth analyses of individual reports or small samples.
