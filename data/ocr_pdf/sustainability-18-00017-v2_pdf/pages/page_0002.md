The complex and often ambiguous nature of greenwashing presents substantial methodological challenges for researchers attempting to identify and measure it. At the same time, these challenges offer valuable opportunities for future inquiry [27]. However, there remains a limited understanding regarding the strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and the approaches used to measure it, including their operationalization, methodologies, and data sources applied in this field [28]. In particular, approaches based on content analysis are especially valuable and offer significant conceptual and empirical insights, given that much of the existing research on greenwashing relies on indicators derived from secondary sources such as dedicated databases and specific ratings, which are not always transparent, are often binary, and may be arbitrary or highly autocorrelated. In fact, using composite ESG indicators derived from secondary sources typically provides only aggregated scores, obscuring which aspect of greenwashing is measured, reducing comparability across heterogeneous providers, and limiting replicability where access to commercial ESG databases is restricted [29,30,31].

Growing scholarly interest in greenwashing has resulted in the publication of several systematic literature reviews [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39] and bibliometric analyses that characterize the structure and trends in this scientific field [40,41,42,43]. Nonetheless, systematic literature reviews focusing specifically on the measurement of greenwashing [32] and greenwashing in sustainability reporting [44,45] remain scarce. This scarcity is particularly evident in relation to strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and to measurement approaches grounded in content-analysis studies.

Given these challenges and the rapidly expanding research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting, it is crucial to build on existing analyses to address persistent gaps and explore under-researched areas.

The main aim of this paper, therefore, is to systematically organize and synthesize the current literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies in this field. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive syntheses to date of strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and provide an integrated, conceptually grounded overview of existing approaches and analytical techniques used to measure and detect greenwashing through content analysis. In particular, our systematic literature review aims to address the following research questions, which have not been sufficiently explored in existing research:What strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting have been identified in the literature?What content analysis--based measurement approaches are used to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting?

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the research methodology. In Section 3, the results are presented and discussed. Section 4 identifies areas for future research and Section 5 provides concluding remarks and acknowledges the study's limitations.

## 2. Materials and Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. As a rigorous and structured research method, an SLR facilitates a comprehensive examination of scholarly works within a specific research domain. This approach enables the mapping and synthesis of existing knowledge while providing insight into the interconnections among studies. Furthermore, it supports the identification, classification, and critical evaluation of the current body of literature, thereby establishing a foundation for recognizing research gaps and proposing future research directions [28,35,46,47].
