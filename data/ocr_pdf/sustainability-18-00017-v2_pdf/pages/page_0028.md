# 5. Conclusions

This SLR offers a comprehensive synthesis of research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting. The findings reveal that greenwashing is a multifaceted phenomenon, manifesting through both explicit communicative strategies and more subtle reporting practices. Drawing on a rigorous content analysis of 88 studies, we identify strategic typologies of greenwashing and examine the content-analysis-based measurement approaches employed to detect them.

Greenwashing in sustainability reporting, as highlighted by our SLR, is a complex and multidimensional corporate behavior rather than a uniform practice. Companies often navigate a continuum between substantive action and symbolic disclosure, strategically calibrating the two to balance actual performance with desired perception. This challenges binary typologies and highlights the need for more nuanced conceptual frameworks. Equally important is what companies do not disclose—strategic silence or greenhushing—which reveals a covert dimension of impression management that is often overlooked. Stakeholder perceptions also play a pivotal role: the same report may be viewed as credible by one audience but dismissed as greenwashing by another, reflecting differential interpretations shaped by stakeholder expertise, situational expectations, and evaluative heuristics.

Our SLR identifies three principal content-analysis-based approaches to measuring greenwashing: (1) the disclosure-performance gap, which compares reported versus actual ESG performance; (2) the symbolic-substantive approach, which contrasts qualitative statements with verifiable organizational actions; and (3) selective and manipulative disclosure, which examines biased messaging, tone, and visual framing techniques used to influence stakeholder perceptions. We also show that analytical techniques for detecting greenwashing increasingly focus on linguistic and visual cues in sustainability reports—tone (sentiment and narrative framing), readability (traditional readability indices and machine-learning-based textual-complexity measures), and visual elements (selective emphasis, imagery framing, and graphical distortions). Finally, we contrast empirically substantiated cases of greenwashing with studies relying on simplified or untested assumptions.

We outline several future research directions to deepen our understanding of greenwashing practices pursued by companies and strengthen the detection and deterrence mechanisms available to stakeholders and regulators. Our findings underscore the need for a holistic, multi-theoretic approach to conceptualizing greenwashing, alongside practical and policy interventions that enhance transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting. Of the future research avenues outlined in this paper, we highlight those we consider most urgent. Collectively, these priorities emphasize methodological rigor and empirical validation, guiding future studies to advance greenwashing research, to help companies avoid deceptive reporting, and to equip policymakers with evidence-based strategies for corporate accountability.

The first priority is aligning corporate disclosures with actual performance. Researchers should link narrative claims to verified ESG metrics using data-driven approaches,
