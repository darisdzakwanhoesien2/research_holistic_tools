countermeasures, and omission. Laufer [76] argued that companies use defensive strategies to protect themselves from liability, both internally and externally, with greenwashing relying on three key elements of deception: confusion, fronting, and posturing. Companies sometimes engage in strategic silence, with sustainability reports omitting concrete strategies for managing or curbing overproduction—a form of vagueness recognized as a signal of greenwashing [77]. Research by Roszkowska-Menkes et al. [9] identified the selective disclosure of negative events in sustainability reporting, manifested in three forms: vague disclosure, avoidance, and hypocrisy. In addition, Gentile and Gupta [78] identified several strategies adopted by leading global fossil fuel companies, including necessitarianism; greenwashing, manifested through claims of sustainability, strategic wording, overstated commitments, half-truths, the use of ‘net-zero' as a marketing label, and avoidance of critical issues (‘the elephant in the room'); strategic blame placement; and techno-optimism.

Considering how visual elements can be leveraged to influence CSR reports, Friedel [79] emphasized the strategic use of images and text and their impact on the perceived objectivity and construction of truth, highlighting how corporate myths are created and maintained to enhance organizational legitimacy. Additionally, Cho et al. [80] and Cüre et al. [81] investigated corporate manipulation of graphs in sustainability reporting and identified two impression management strategies—enhancement and obfuscation—evidenced by the selective presentation of graphical data emphasizing favorable trends and the inclusion of material distortions within the graphs.

Research shows that to assume that companies adopt uniform sustainability reporting strategies is a significant oversimplification. Moreover, ESG practices are driven by diverse motivations, including strategic, altruistic, and greenwashing-related incentives [82]. Schons and Steinmeier [10] argue that companies can adopt strategies that combine symbolic and substantive CSR actions. This means that some of them may choose not to engage in CSR at all—either symbolically or substantively—and then they are referred to as Neglectors. Other companies may decide to focus primarily on symbolic actions (Greenwashers), who follow a “mere talk” strategy, or on substantive actions (Silent Saints), who adopt a “mere walk” strategy. Finally, some companies may demonstrate high levels of both symbolic and substantive engagement, acting as Balanced Engagers who “walk the talk”. Siano et al. [12] argued that the simple distinction between talk and action is insufficient. Following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, they expanded the greenwashing taxonomy—originally encompassing decoupling and attention deflection—by identifying a new form of irresponsible behavior, namely “deceptive manipulation,” in which sustainability communication is deliberately used to manipulate actual business practices. Furthermore, Cho et al. [83] argued that more diverse and nuanced theoretical perspectives are needed to understand sustainability reporting, as conflicting societal and institutional pressures can force companies to engage in organizational hypocrisy by creating and maintaining discrepant façades, such as rational, progressive, and reputational.

Considering research on strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting, most studies in this domain can be viewed as extending or complementing one another rather than offering contradictory insights. Apparent inconsistencies typically stem from scholars examining different dimensions of greenwashing—for instance, exaggerated optimism versus subtle forms of denial, or text-based versus visual communication strategies. Moreover, the literature has evolved from simple 2 × 2 typologies toward more sophisticated frameworks that either position strategic responses to institutional pressures along a passive--active continuum or conceptualize varying forms and degrees of obfuscation or deception.
