legitimacy demands jointly shape disclosure behavior. Moreover, most current analyses focus on isolated narrative fragments—such as specific phrases or report sections—rather than evaluating the broader alignment between the company's overall discourse and verified ESG outcomes. This narrow focus constrains the ability to detect symbolic decoupling at scale. Future research should adopt more comprehensive, firm-level approaches that link entire report contents to quantifiable performance indicators [102,108]. Digital transparency tools and emerging technological systems also merit greater attention. While some recent studies acknowledge the growing adoption of digital reporting mechanisms, empirical evidence on their impact remains scarce [30,107]. Future research could examine whether tools such as real-time ESG dashboards, structured data reporting, and algorithmic monitoring reduce company' capacity to engage in symbolic disclosure.

Detecting greenwashing through selective disclosure and narrative manipulation likewise represents a rapidly developing research area. Yet, a key limitation lies in the absence of standardized procedures for identifying and classifying such practices across industries, languages, and coding systems. Current studies often rely on heterogeneous textual metrics without confirming measurement invariance, which undermines comparability and replicability [111,116,118]. Future research should aim to establish unified codebooks and multilingual natural language processing (NLP) pipelines, complemented by manual validation of sampled text segments to ensure methodological robustness. The role of institutional investors in shaping information opacity also remains underexplored. Although prior studies have pointed to the potential emergence of “disclosure fog” in ESG communication, few have empirically examined whether institutional ownership correlates with hedging language, lexical dilution, or selective ESG narrative construction [107,112]. A promising avenue for future research involves exploring whether and how companies imitate competitors' selective disclosure strategies. Textual similarity measures could help detect industry-specific patterns of imitation—such as linguistic convergence in phrasing, tone, or narrative structure [114,117]. Additionally, further investigation is needed into the strategic manipulation of ESG topic emphasis, wherein companies may disproportionately highlight less material or less scrutinized themes. Empirical evidence remains limited regarding whether such shifts in topic salience reflect deliberate narrative avoidance [109,115]. Future studies should apply systematic text-analytic approaches to detect and evaluate the prevalence and implications of these distortive practices in sustainability reporting.

Research suggests that, while tone analysis in sustainability reporting can be used to detect potential greenwashing, its conceptualization and operationalization remain insufficiently developed. Many studies rely on generic sentiment dictionaries or document-level scores, which risk conflating genuine optimism with impression management, thereby highlighting the need for more nuanced, domain-specific measures [74,119,124]. A key priority should therefore be domain adaptation: specifically, the development of ESG-specific lexicons and fine-tuned models that capture sectoral jargon, regulatory terminology, and claim types, while differentiating genuinely informative positive language from rhetorical attempts at attention deflection. In addition, reporting tactics tend to be localized rather than distributed across an entire document. Positive tone frequently clusters in CEO letters, highlights, or specific KPI sections, whereas negative information is often abstracted, minimized, or relegated to footnotes. These patterns underscore the importance of section- or span-level analyses linked to verifiable performance metrics [70,120]. Current research on tone remains largely monomodal, focusing exclusively on textual content while neglecting images, charts, and other visual or structural cues that can also signal greenwashing. This calls for moving beyond text-only measures toward integrated, multimodal approaches that combine tone, readability, visual analysis, and claim verification. Future studies should therefore tailor sentiment measures to sustainability-specific language, link
