In summary, methods for measuring greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability disclosures and performance consistently draw on the notion of the "talk-walk gap," but operationalize it in different ways, thus yielding different analytical insights. Checklist-based indices provide transparency and close alignment with reporting standards but are highly labor-intensive and limited in scalability. Keyword-frequency approaches offer strong scalability but primarily measure the volume of ESG communication, which can lead to inflated perceptions of disclosure quality. More advanced approaches—such as quality-weighted metrics, sentiment analysis, and broader NLP techniques—more effectively capture discrepancies between communication and actual performance, but they require specialized tools and expertise, and their outputs may diverge from those produced by simpler measures. On the performance side, ESG ratings, hard ESG indicators, and checklist-based indices capture distinct facets of sustainability, resulting in varying assessments of the same companies. ESG ratings face additional challenges due to methodological opacity, dependence on corporate disclosures, and inconsistency across providers. Overall, the evidence suggests that disclosure and performance measures should be viewed as complementary: differences between them reflect the multidimensional nature of greenwashing rather than measurement error.

# 3.2.2. Symbolic and Substantive Disclosure Approach

The second methodological approach conceptualizes greenwashing as the distinction between symbolic and substantive sustainability disclosures, determined by the credibility, specificity, and verifiability of the information provided. Within this framework, it is assumed that companies may use sustainability rhetoric as a means of gaining legitimacy by emphasizing broad commitments or aspirational claims that are not substantiated by verifiable actions, measurable outcomes, or tangible resource allocations. Consequently,
