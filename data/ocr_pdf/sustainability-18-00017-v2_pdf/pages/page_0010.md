# 3.2. Approaches to Measuring Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Using Content Analysis 3.2.1. Disclosure-Performance Gap Approach

One of the main approaches used to measure greenwashing in sustainability reporting focuses on the discrepancy between sustainability disclosure (D) and actual sustainability performance (P). Within this framework, researchers quantify ESG disclosure (i.e., what companies communicate about their sustainability actions) separately from ESG performance (i.e., what companies actually achieve). Greenwashing is thus conceptualized as the difference, imbalance, or misalignment between these two constructs. This approach builds on the "talk-walk gap" perspective, which assumes that companies may deliberately overstate their sustainability commitments when actual performance fails to support the communicated narrative.

In accordance with the inclusion criteria adopted in this review, the analyzed sample consists exclusively of studies in which at least one component of greenwashing measurement—disclosure and/or performance—is derived from content analysis of sustainability-related reports. While content analysis is most frequently applied to capture the scope and characteristics of sustainability disclosure [1,11,23,84-94], the sample also includes studies in which both disclosure and performance measures are extracted from sustainability report content and subsequently coded using predefined analytical schemes [95-99].

Various methods have been employed to quantify sustainability disclosure. The most prevalent approach involves counting the frequency of environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) keywords and normalizing these counts by the total word count of sustainability reports [23,84,88]. Some studies further refined this approach by weighting ESG terminology according to its contextual relevance or importance [86,97-99], or by assigning differentiated weights to monetary, quantitative, and purely narrative statements
