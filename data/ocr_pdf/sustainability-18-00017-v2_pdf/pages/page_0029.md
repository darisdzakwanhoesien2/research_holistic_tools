including supervised machine learning, to detect inconsistencies. Longitudinal case studies can further capture shifts between substantive and symbolic reporting over time. This line of inquiry responds to calls for more systematic alignment of sustainability narratives with performance outcomes, enabling academics to refine existing theories, helping managers identify communication blind spots, and allowing regulators to target audits more effectively where claims diverge from underlying metrics.

Closely related is the need to study “greenhushing”—strategic omissions in sustainability communication. Companies' silence on material issues often escapes conventional analytical techniques. Future research should model disclosure decisions at the margin, identifying what is omitted and why, using methods such as anonymous managerial surveys, KPI-report gap analyses, and sector-specific case studies in high-risk industries. This complements work on overstated claims, reveals the concealed side of impression management, refines theories of decoupling, alerts companies to the risks embedded in nondisclosure, and supports policymakers in closing omission-based loopholes.

Another underexplored area is expanding greenwashing research on SMEs and emerging-market businesses. Our SLR shows that most empirical evidence is concentrated among large, publicly traded companies in developed countries. It is therefore critical to examine whether greenwashing typologies apply across diverse organizational and institutional contexts. Multi-country studies using context-rich interviews and comparative content analysis could illuminate local disclosure practices, refine theoretical generalizability, provide practitioners with more relevant benchmarks, and help policymakers tailor reporting standards to heterogeneous business environments.

A further priority is evaluating the causal impact of regulations and assurance mechanisms on greenwashing. Although external assurance and mandatory reporting standards are often assumed to deter deceptive communication, robust empirical evidence remains limited. Quasi-experimental designs—such as difference-in-differences around new disclosure mandates or transitions from limited to reasonable assurance—could credibly isolate these effects. Establishing causal relationships would advance legitimacy theory, guide regulators in evaluating policy effectiveness, and help companies understand the true costs and benefits of compliance.

The rise of generative AI (LLMs) in sustainability reporting constitutes a timely and increasingly consequential research frontier. AI-assisted writing may standardize stylistic features, homogenize tone, and amplify optimism bias in ways that subtly shape stakeholder interpretations. Comparative studies of human and AI-authored excerpts—using stylometric techniques, semantic-shift analyses, and hybrid human-AI annotation—can uncover nuanced linguistic changes introduced by AI tools. Curated and labeled datasets can further support models designed to detect AI-driven alterations in sustainability narratives. Such research becomes particularly urgent in the light of rapid AI adoption, offering insights into emerging forms of impression management, alerting companies to AI-driven biases, and informing regulators as they consider guidelines for the responsible use of AI in reporting.

A cross-cutting priority is the standardization and validation of measurement approaches. Developing unified codebooks, ESG sentiment lexicons, and validated NLP pipelines—tested across languages, industries, and reporting regimes—would enhance construct clarity, methodological comparability, and replicability. A more cohesive analytical framework would facilitate reliable academic comparisons, provide practitioners with dependable benchmarks for assessing reports, and equip regulators with robust indicators to support enforcement and oversight.

Future research should also advance toward the use of multimodal content analysis. Constructing multimodal pipelines that integrate NLP, readability metrics, and visual
