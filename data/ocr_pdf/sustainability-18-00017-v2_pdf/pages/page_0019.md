comparative evaluation of CSR reports against external data on Foxconn, Noronha and Wang [13] identified a disclosure--performance gap attributed to greenwashing. This gap stemmed from selectively highlighting positive aspects while omitting negative social performance details, particularly in cases involving incomplete disclosure and non-compliance with reporting guidelines. Analyzing the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Siano et al. [12] compared the Volkswagen Group's CSR reports with media coverage exposing the “Dieselgate” controversy—representing the public revelation of greenwashing—and identified false claims and deliberate manipulation within these reports. Contreras-Pacheco and Claasen [136] identified clear signals of fuzzy reporting as a form of greenwashing. They examined the environmental disaster through events before, during, and following the incident, focusing on the company's disclosure practices, and found that the firm adapted its narrative over time to align with changing stakeholder expectations. In a related vein, Roszkowska-Menkes et al. [9] identified forms of selective disclosure by analyzing companies involved in severe controversies and assessing whether, and to what extent, these controversies and their associated negative events were reported in sustainability disclosures. Corciolani et al. [131], analyzing evidence of negative impacts on human rights, demonstrated how the language of CSR reports can be strategically used to offset companies' involvement in corporate social irresponsibility (CSIR). Finally, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] analyzed how penalized environmental violations influence CSR report readability and sentiment, observing that violating companies tend to adopt a more assertive and overly positive tone while disclosing larger volumes of environmental information—resulting in reports that are more extensive yet less readable.

### 3.3.5. Oversimplified Assumptions of Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting

In our opinion, some studies are built on assumptions that oversimplify the detection of greenwashing in sustainability reporting.

Some scholars assume that merely issuing CSR reports by companies with poor corporate social performance—or exhibiting a low degree of conformity with the GRI Sustainability Framework and Standards—constitutes evidence of greenwashing, consistent with a symbolic management approach [137]. In this context, Karaman et al. [138] argued that the presence of greenwashing tendencies in the energy sector could be dismissed, as companies with superior CSR performance were more likely to issue CSR reports. Similarly, Koseoglu et al. [139] found that high-performing companies in the hospitality and tourism industry were more likely to publish CSR reports, adopt the GRI framework, and obtain external assurance—thereby providing grounds for rejecting the greenwashing hypothesis in that sector. Mahoney et al. [140] posited—consistent with a signaling theory perspective—that stronger CSR performers issue reports to signal genuine commitment to sustainability, whereas weaker performers use them to project an image of responsibility despite poorer records, thereby engaging in greenwashing. However, it should be noted that none of these three studies employed content-analysis-based methods, which limits their ability to directly assess communicative or linguistic indicators of greenwashing.

Taking into account other studies that, in our view, also oversimplify greenwashing detection in sustainability reporting, Lewis [141] argued that multinational corporations may be accused of greenwashing if they either omit any discussion of their supply chain's environmental impact or report on it only at the level of values and goals, without providing substantive or verifiable details. Additionally, drawing on an assessment of the quality of sustainability disclosures among Australian companies, Zharfpeykan and Akroyd [142] argued that companies tend to adopt greenwashing strategies when the quality of disclosures on material issues either declines or fluctuates—patterns suggesting attempts to obscure weak social and/or environmental performance.
