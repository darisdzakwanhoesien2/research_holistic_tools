companies, and suggested that companies may engage in greenwashing through the use of an abnormally positive tone in their CSR disclosures.

An alternative approach was proposed by Chen and Ma [91], who used the Term Frequency--Inverse Document Frequency algorithm and derived an “ESG greenwashing tone” from the frequencies of positive and negative emotion words and assessed greenwashing as the discrepancy between that tone and the firms' ESG performance. Chen et al. [92] similarly computed decoupling as the difference between an ESG report's optimistic tone—estimated using the Loughran--McDonald lexicon—and actual ESG performance, with both quantities standardized to z-scores, such that larger values indicate greater decoupling. A similar approach was employed by Sauerwald and Su [93] and Zhang [94], who linked the optimistic tone of CSR-reports to corporate social performance; however, Zhang [94] cautioned that relying on the tone--performance gap as a proxy for CSR decoupling has notable limitations.

### 3.3.2. Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Through Readability Analysis

Readability analysis of sustainability reporting aids in detecting greenwashing by examining sentence length, word complexity, jargon use, and overall clarity, which may reveal when complex or technical wording is strategically employed to obscure weak CSR performance. Some studies treat greenwashing and report readability as distinct constructs yet find a significant negative association, indicating that lower readability corresponds to higher levels of greenwashing [127]. However, several studies directly infer greenwashing and obfuscation from the readability metrics in sustainability reports.

Liao et al. [125] suggested that companies engage in greenwashing of ESG reports by “talking more and doing less,” as evidenced by textual analysis of ESG-related word frequencies relative to overall report length (based on Loughran--McDonald's word list). A study by Esterhuyse and du Toit [120] revealed that low-disclosure companies engaged in obfuscation by reducing report readability, as measured by the Flesch Reading Ease Index, which accounts for average sentence length and syllables per word. Using the same index and based on the Textstat library, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] quantified the readability of CSR reports and interacted it with the environmental score to examine greenwashing mechanisms. In turn, Fabrizio and Kim [128] analyzed voluntary responses to CDP's Climate Change Survey to investigate linguistic obfuscation in environmental disclosures, using the Lingua::EN::Fathom package in Perl and the Gunning Fog Index to measure text complexity based on syllables per word and words per sentence. Martínez-Ferrero et al. [74] showed that companies with poor CSR performance employ obfuscation strategies by producing longer, less readable reports containing less accurate and transparent information. They assessed report accuracy and clarity using metrics such as the total number of pages and words, the ratio of numerical characters to total characters and words, and highlighted that “soft” information (text) is more cognitively demanding to process than “hard” information (numbers).

Some studies use multiple metrics to assess the readability of sustainability reports. For example, Fisher et al. [119] analyzed corporate accountability disclosures using Flesch Reading Ease as the primary index, complemented by the Flesch--Kincaid, SMOG, and Gunning Fog. Similarly, Nazari et al. [129] applied a comprehensive set of readability and disclosure-size measures—Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch--Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog, Coleman--Liau, SMOG, and the Automated Readability Index—and found that shorter, less readable CSR disclosures were associated with poorer CSR performance, thereby suggesting the presence of greenwashing. Nilipour et al. [130] found that longer sustainability reports tend to have lower readability scores. Drawing on the ReadablePro online readability tool and using five readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau,
