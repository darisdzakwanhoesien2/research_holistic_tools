The SLR presented in this study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines [48]. The review utilized the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection databases, selected for their reliability, relevance, and frequent use in systematic reviews [35,49]. In addition, these databases are the most widely used citation indexes in the world, and, consequently, most bibliometric and scientometric tools are based on them [50,51].

To improve methodological robustness, the selection of search terms was informed by a comprehensive review of previous SLRs and bibliometric analyses on greenwashing [28,35,36,37,39], sustainability reporting [52,53,54,55], and research integrating both topics [45]. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the research field, a thorough search was conducted using keywords that combined terms related to greenwashing and sustainability reporting.

First, we created a list of terms describing greenwashing activities, which included the following keywords: “greenwash”, “green wash”, “green-wash*”, “decoupling”, “cheating”, “obfuscation”, and “deceptive”.

Second, given the diverse terminology used in extensive sustainability reporting research, a detailed search was conducted using keywords such as “sustainability report*/disclosure”, “sustainable development report*/disclosure”, “corporate social responsibility report*/disclosure”, “CSR report*/disclosure”, “responsib* report*/disclosure”, “ESG report*/disclosure”, “corporate citizenship report*/disclosure”, “triple bottom line report*/disclosure”, “TBL report*/disclosure”, “GRI report*/disclosure”, “Global Reporting Initiative report*/disclosure”, “sustainable development goal* report*/disclosure”, “SDG* report*/disclosure”, “integr* report*/disclosure”, “non-financ* report*/disclosure”, “environm* report*/disclosure”, “green report*/disclosure”, “GHG report*/disclosure”, “greenhouse gas report*/disclosure”, “carbon report*/disclosure”, and “social report*/disclosure”.

The list of query words and the combined query string used in this study are provided in Table A1 and Table A2 in the Appendix A.

Next, we defined the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review (Table A3 in the Appendix A). A study was considered eligible if the publication explicitly addressed the phenomenon of greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting as a primary research topic. In addition, the study had to discuss greenwashing strategies or methods for measuring greenwashing that were grounded in content analysis of sustainability reporting. We also specified that each study must operationalize at least one dimension of greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability reports or other corporate disclosures containing ESG-related information.

For the exclusion criteria, we omitted publications not written in English, reflecting the dominance of English in scientific communication [56] and reducing language and translation bias [28,57]. We also excluded books, book chapters, editorial materials, meeting abstracts, and data papers, as these document types typically do not undergo a rigorous peer-review process that ensures the reliability and credibility of empirical findings [58]. This approach is standard in many SLRs [28,49]. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table A3 in the Appendix A.

The search was conducted on 17 February 2025, utilizing the query string detailed in Table A2 in the Appendix A. After applying the initial exclusion criteria outlined in phase 1 (document type and language), 249 publications were identified in Scopus and 199 in WoS, resulting in a combined total of 448 records. Following the removal of 174 duplicate records from the two databases, the final dataset consisted of 274 unique publications. To organize key information throughout the process and to facilitate the identification and elimination of duplicates, we used a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

In the subsequent screening stage, the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the 274 publications were reviewed by two researchers (the co-authors) to assess their relevance to the
