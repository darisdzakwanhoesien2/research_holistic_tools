single, universally accepted definition, and its interpretation remains open to debate [2]. It was originally applied to environmental issues and defined as “the intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance” [3]. It was also referred to as “symbolic corporate environmentalism” [4]. Subsequently, the concept evolved into a broader interpretation, described as the “selective disclosure of positive information about a company's environmental or social performance without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image” [5] or the “act of presenting a company's environmental and/or social performance in a misleading way” [6]. Following the triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability and the principles of environmental integrity, social equity, and economic prosperity, addressing environmental, social, and economic issues has become essential to discussions of greenwashing [2].

Greenwashing has been analyzed from various perspectives, with the literature presenting different conceptualizations of its relationship to similar notions. Some authors interpret it as a form of decoupling [7], highlighting the discrepancy between dissemination of symbolic statements (“talk”) and actual actions (“walk”) [8]. Others view greenwashing as a concept that describes decoupling processes within the context of sustainability, treating greenwashing and decoupling as synonyms [9,10,11]. Yet, Siano et al. [12] distinguish between two primary types of greenwashing: decoupling and attention deflection. In this context, decoupling refers to the gap between disclosure and performance [13] or between policy statements and actual corporate commitment [14], as well as the disconnection between means and ends [15]. It also includes impression management practices that involve “empty green claims and policies” and “sin of fibbing”, in which companies make claims that are outright false [16]. Impression management encompasses emphasizing positive organizational outcomes (enhancement) or obfuscating negative organizational outcomes (concealment) [17].

Attention deflection, as the act of concealing unethical business practices, encompasses various deceptive communication tactics, such as selective and inaccurate disclosure [5], including incomplete comparisons and vague or irrelevant statements [18]. It also involves misleading written texts and visual imagery [19] as well as unverifiable claims, such as implied superiority and the “sin of no proof”, where assertions lack substantiating evidence or accessible supporting information [20].

Greenwashing involves both the overstatement of positive performance and the concealment of negative information [21,22]. It encompasses a broad range of practices commonly characterized by the dissemination of misleading information [23], including various forms of false claims rooted in hypocrisy and/or deception [24]. Some authors connect greenwashing with the obfuscation of negative sustainability information, suggesting that companies with inferior sustainability performance use complex, ambiguous language to produce intentionally opaque or confusing reports [25]. This means that greenwashing can be identified through linguistic patterns, which often rely on overly optimistic terms that emphasize positive aspects. Accordingly, the literature on greenwashing is closely related to research on selective disclosure, in which favorable information is emphasized while unfavorable details are minimized or omitted [26].

In this paper, we refer to greenwashing in sustainability reporting as the deliberate or unintended dissemination of misleading, incomplete, or overly favorable sustainability-related disclosures. It is manifested through the selective presentation of positive information, the concealment or obfuscation of negative performance, or the decoupling of reported claims from underlying organizational practices. This process constructs an unjustifiably positive impression of corporate sustainability by overstating positive actions and concealing negative ones.
