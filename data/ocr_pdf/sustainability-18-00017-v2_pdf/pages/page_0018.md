SMOG, and Automated Readability Index), they suggested that information overload and reduced readability may serve to obfuscate negative information. Wang et al. [25] suggested that companies with poor CSR performance may engage in greenwashing by employing complex language to produce vague reports, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse stakeholder reactions. To assess the readability of CSR reports, they applied three indices--Fog, Flesch, and Kincaid--to evaluate the overall difficulty of comprehension.

In a slightly different approach, Conrad and Holtbrügge [121] used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC2015) to analyze morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in sustainability reports, finding that decoupling companies employ less cognitively complex language and exhibit lower linguistic sophistication. Using the same software, Corciolani et al. [131] measured analytical and authentic language in CSR reports and showed that greater involvement in corporate social irresponsibility is associated with more narrative (as opposed to analytical) and more deceptive (as opposed to authentic) language.

It should also be noted that, using machine learning and text analysis, Pan et al. [132] identified an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental performance feedback and the readability of CSR reports among Chinese SMEs. In this case, readability was operationalized using a word2vec CBOW model trained on CSR reports to predict target words from their surrounding context.

### 3.3.3. Detecting Greenwashing Through Visual Imagery Analysis

Considering how visual elements can be leveraged to influence sustainability reporting, Friedel [79]—in one of the first studies in this field—argued that the strategic use of imagery in CSR reports, such as depictions of Indigenous bodies and landscapes, was designed to alleviate public concerns about the environmental impacts of fossil fuel production and may represent a distinct form of greenwashing. Hrasky [133] examined the number, size, and types of graphs and photographs related to the three dimensions of sustainability—economic, social, and environmental. The analysis revealed that sustainability-oriented companies used fewer photographs and relied more on quantitative data presented in graphical form within sustainability reports to highlight measurable impacts. In contrast, less sustainable companies pursued symbolic legitimacy, using imagery lacking concrete action as a greenwashing tool in sustainability communication with stakeholders. Cho et al. [80] identified the enhancement strategy by examining whether a significantly larger proportion of graphed items in sustainability reports displayed favorable trends. Additionally, they assessed obfuscation by identifying graphical distortions that presented favorable information, thereby serving as tools for impression management. A similar approach was adopted by Cüre et al. [81] to identify enhancement and obfuscation as impression-management strategies, analyzing graphs with both favorable and unfavorable trends and detecting visual distortions used to manipulate perception.

### 3.3.4. Evidence of Real Greenwashing

While the existing greenwashing literature predominantly addresses alleged or theoretical cases, only a small subset examines instances that have been empirically verified.

Examining the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Mobus [134] analyzed BP's pre-crisis CSR disclosures on environmental and safety performance, thematic trends in newspaper coverage during the crisis, and post-crisis findings on contributing conditions, thereby demonstrating the risks of relying on self-reported sources that provide strong incentives to emphasize favorable information while omitting adverse details. Du [135] used the Greenwashing Identification Committee's list—published by South Weekend, one of China's most influential newspapers—to detect greenwashing, thereby demonstrating that this list can serve as an empirical verification tool for confirmed cases.
