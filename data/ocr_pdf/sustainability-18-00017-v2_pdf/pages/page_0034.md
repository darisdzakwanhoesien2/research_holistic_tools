|  Authors | Theoretical Framework | Research Sample Characteristics | Characteristics of Strategic Approaches  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  García-Sánchez et al. [69] | Legitimacy theory, impression management theory | 69 Spanish companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange | Legitimization strategy—involves neutral discourse aimed at legitimizing current practices and signaling future commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals.Proactive impression management strategy—emphasizes congratulatory messaging, self-promotion, and organizational promotion.Defensive impression management strategy—focuses on responding to negative situations through explanations, justifications, or apologies.  |
|  Gentile and Gupta [78] | Theoretical concept of petroculture | Royal Dutch Shell's sustainability reports2005-2021 | Necessitarianism—framing fossil fuels as essential and irreplaceable.Greenwashing:Claiming sustainability—presenting sustainability as a core value while emphasizing the ongoing necessity of fossil fuels in the energy market.Strategic word use—substituting terms such as "oil" with broader, more neutral language like "energy."Overstating commitment—exaggerating renewable energy commitments to obscure continued fossil fuel dependence.Half-truths—selectively presenting or cherry-picking facts to fit the narrative.Net-zero—using net-zero as a marketing label for legitimizing the status quo.Avoiding the elephant in the room—signaling apparent commitment to transition while refusing to phase out fossil fuels, thus undermining its logic.Strategic blame placement—portraying the fossil fuel industry simultaneously as a leader in the energy transition and as a victim, thereby excusing inaction.Techno-optimism—placing blind faith in fossil-fuel-based technologies, with exclusively optimistic and often unrealistic claims.  |
|  Hahn and LülfS [70] | Voluntary disclosure theory, signaling theory, legitimacy theory | 40 sustainability reports (19 from companies listed on U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average Index companies and 21 from German DAX Index companies)2010-2011 | Marginalization—portraying negative aspects as non-relevant.Abstraction—generalizing negative aspects as widespread across the entire industry.Indicating facts—acknowledging the existence of a negative aspect without elaboration.Rationalization—Instrumental: emphasizing benefits, functions, or purposes that justify the negative aspect; Theoretical: framing negative aspects as a "normal fact of life" or as inevitable occurrences.Authorization—involving authorities to legitimize actions or explanations.Corrective action—Type 1: providing vague or imprecise ideas or measures for addressing negative aspects in the future; Type 2: offering concrete ideas or measures for addressing negative aspects in the future.  |
