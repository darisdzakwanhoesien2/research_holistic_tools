|  Authors | Theoretical Framework | Research Sample Characteristics | Characteristics of Strategic Approaches  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Talbot and Barbat [67] | Impression management theory | 58 sustainability reports published by mining companies from different countries2015 | Strategic omission—deliberately omitting information that could negatively affect perceptions of the company's water performance (e.g., presenting incomplete data).Obfuscation—manipulating figures and information to obscure the intended message (e.g., providing non-aggregated data or using new measures to influence stakeholders' perceptions).Minimizing the impact of mining on water resources—emphasizing that the water used is of poor quality and is reused multiple times in production processes.Relativizing poor water performance—contextualizing poor water performance by considering other factors or situating it within a broader temporal and environmental context.  |
|  Yuan et al. [72] | Signaling theory | A sample of 7427 observations from Chinese listed companies2011–2020 | Exaggerating—overstating environmental efforts, creating a gap between actual performance and disclosed information.Distracting—presenting an appearance of pursuing one path while following a different course, highlighting a gap between perceived strengths and actual concerns.Window-dressing—making superficial adjustments to reports or disclosures to appear favorable, reflecting a gap between material and immaterial aspects.  |
