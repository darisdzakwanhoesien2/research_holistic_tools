Specifically, we explore how combinations of the level and scope of assurance, and the type of assurance provider are associated with a reduction in CSR decoupling. Using an international sample of publicly listed firms, we find that CSR decoupling is significantly reduced when firms obtain reasonable assurance together with either a broad assurance scope or an assurance provider from the auditing profession. These results suggest that reasonable assurance provides a necessary foundation for reducing CSR decoupling, but its effectiveness is contingent on its combination with either a broad assurance scope or an assurance provider from the auditing profession. This highlights the importance of comprehensive CSR assurance practices in meaningfully addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance, whereas CSR assurance practices that meet only the minimum standards primarily serve a symbolic role, enhancing legitimacy. We discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers and investors.\n\n# 1 | Introduction\n\nThis study examines the relationship between external assurance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and CSR decoupling. In response to growing pressures from investors and other stakeholders to become more accountable for the impacts of their activities on the environment and society, companies are expected\u2014or even legally obliged\u2014to enhance transparency. Although they increasingly disclose information on CSR performance (Lin et al. 2024), stakeholders remain concerned about CSR decoupling. Prior literature defines CSR decoupling as \u201ca symbolic strategy whereby firms overstate their CSR performance in their disclosures to strengthen their legitimacy\u201d (Tashman et al. 2019, 154; see also Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022;\n\nSauerwald and Su 2019). Companies may use CSR decoupling as a strategic tool to shape stakeholders' perceptions by communicating CSR actions that are not matched by substantive efforts (Hawn and Ioannou 2016; Marquis et al. 2016; Cho and Patten 2007).\n\nTo address increasing concerns from investors and other stakeholders about the credibility and reliability of the CSR information presented in CSR reports, CSR assurance serves as an external monitoring mechanism to enhance stakeholders' confidence in the credibility of the CSR information disclosed (Adams and Evans 2004; Brown-Liburd and Zamora 2015; Du and Wu 2019). For companies, obtaining external assurance signals that their reported CSR performance is fairly presented\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

In parallel, policymakers have increasingly integrated assurance requirements into CSR disclosure regulations to improve the credibility of reported information at a systemic level. For instance, the EU has adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which initially mandates limited assurance for CSR disclosures. Similarly, other jurisdictions, such as South Africa, have introduced assurance obligations for CSR information (Ackers and Eccles 2015). However, both in voluntary and mandatory settings, CSR assurance may vary considerably in terms of the level and scope of assurance, and the choice of the assurance provider. The level of assurance ranges from reasonable assurance to limited assurance, and the scope of assurance may cover the entire report or be limited to specific sections. For an independent assurance provider, companies can choose assurance providers from either the auditing profession or non-auditing professions.\n\nIn voluntary settings, managers from companies with poor CSR performance facing public pressures and legitimacy threats may strategically benefit from less comprehensive assurance practices (i.e. limited instead of reasonable assurance and a narrower scope of assurance) to proactively shape stakeholders' perceptions of the credibility of the CSR information disclosed, while deflecting attention from poor CSR performance (Unerman 2008; O'Dwyer et al. 2011; Perego and Kolk 2012). They may exercise their managerial discretion to primarily use CSR assurance as a self-serving risk management tool to enhance external legitimacy and corporate reputation through symbolic communication about their CSR actions in CSR reports, without being adequately supported by substantive CSR actions (Bothello et al. 2023; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022; Bromley and Powell 2012; Marquis et al. 2016; Velte 2021). Such practices raise doubts about the actual effectiveness of CSR assurance in reducing CSR decoupling and in enhancing the transparency and decision-usefulness of CSR reports for investors and other stakeholders (Boiral et al. 2019; Talbot and Boiral 2018; Michelon et al. 2015).\n\nIn mandatory settings, policymakers face important cost--benefit trade-offs when determining the appropriate level and scope of assurance in disclosure regulations (Leuz and Wysocki 2016; Christensen et al. 2021). These trade-offs have recently become evident in the EU Omnibus discussions (European Commission 2025), which ultimately led to the abandonment of the initially ambitious goal of requiring reasonable assurance for CSR disclosures aimed at elevating their quality to the level of financial reporting for all firms subject to the CSRD. To assess and evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure regulations in enhancing CSR reporting quality and credibility, it is important to develop a deeper understanding of how variations in CSR assurance choices may relate to variations in CSR decoupling. Specifically, the influence of combinations of CSR assurance choices on CSR decoupling remains underexplored (Aboud et al. 2024).\n\nIn this study, we aim to enhance understanding of the relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. To this end, we examine how combinations of assurance level, assurance scope, and the type of assurance provider are associated with reductions in CSR decoupling. Using a unique international panel dataset of publicly listed firms from 2010 to 2022, the results show that reductions in CSR decoupling are significantly negatively associated with the combination of reasonable assurance and a broad scope of assurance, as well as with reasonable assurance and providers from the auditing profession. This highlights the importance of comprehensive assurance practices in meaningfully addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance.\n\nOur study contributes to ongoing research on the effectiveness of CSR assurance in enhancing CSR reporting quality by being among the first to systematically examine how combinations of CSR assurance choices relate to CSR decoupling (Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022; Braam and Peeters 2018; Hodge et al. 2009). The findings indicate that the CSR assurance process can help reduce CSR decoupling when reasonable assurance is combined with a broad scope or when reasonable assurance is provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession. They suggest that adopting a CSR assurance approach that exceeds the minimum standards, particularly through combinations involving reasonable assurance, can have synergistic effects in mitigating CSR decoupling.\n\nHowever, the findings show no significant relationships between reductions in CSR decoupling and combinations of limited assurance and other assurance-related choices, indicating that limited assurance is not effective in mitigating CSR decoupling. Instead, our findings suggest that limited assurance primarily serves a symbolic function, enhancing perceived legitimacy, stakeholder trust, and corporate reputation while having little effect on reducing CSR decoupling, and may even contribute to its increase. These findings have important implications for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. From a cost--benefit perspective, the findings are policy-relevant as they inform policymakers about the potential benefits of a comprehensive assurance approach to improving the quality of CSR reporting. Additionally, they help investors and other stakeholders better understand the role of CSR assurance in enhancing the credibility of CSR reports.\n\n## 2 Theoretical Background and Development of Hypotheses\n\nCSR assurance should ensure that the information disclosed in CSR reports is, in all material respects, reliable and accurate, in compliance with reporting standards, and, for this reason, verifiable. It should signal the credibility of corporate CSR disclosures, enhance stakeholders' confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the information disclosed (Brown-Liburd et al. 2018; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022). The process of independent assurance can encourage companies to strengthen their risk management systems, enhance the stakeholders' engagement processes, and improve their accounting systems and reporting practices, enabling them to produce and disclose more reliable and accurate CSR information (Michelon et al. 2015; Braam and Peeters 2018). This, in turn, helps lessen the gap between CSR disclosures and actual performance (Sauerwald and Su 2019), improves\nthe quality of CSR reporting (Ballou et al. 2018; Moroney et al. 2012; Sethi et al. 2017), and fosters greater transparency (Christensen 2016; Christensen et al. 2021). Consistently, Sauerwald and Su (2019) find that CSR assurance reduces CSR decoupling, while Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2022) report a negative but non-significant relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. Furthermore, improved reporting processes and disclosure of higher quality CSR information may strengthen companies' commitment to sustainability and drive sustainable value creation, which may positively influence corporate reputation (Simnett et al. 2009; Pflugrath et al. 2011; Reimsbach et al. 2017; Odriozola and Baraibar-Diez 2017) and companies' competitive position (Lozano and Huisingh 2011; Marin et al. 2012; Lozano 2015).\n\nHowever, managers of companies have flexibility in choices related to CSR assurance. Managerial capture, which refers to management's control over CSR reporting and assurance processes (O'Dwyer 2003; O'Dwyer and Owen 2005; Michelon et al. 2015), allows managers to strategically exercise control and discretion in making choices related to the level and scope of assurance, as well as the choice for an assurance provider. In this study, we posit that companies with low levels of CSR decoupling are expected to make different choices related to the level and scope of CSR assurance and the assurance provider to distinguish themselves from companies with high levels of CSR decoupling. Reasonable (positive) assurance offers a higher level of assurance and requires an assurance provider to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to conclude that the disclosed CSR information is free from material misstatements. It more likely enhances the credibility and reliability of CSR disclosures for stakeholders than limited (negative) assurance. In terms of scope, assuring the entire CSR report signals a stronger commitment to transparency and accountability in CSR practices than a limited scope. While a restricted scope may draw attention to specific sections, it can also raise concerns about the company's overall transparency and integrity in its CSR efforts.\n\nCombinations of reasonable assurance and broad scope provide higher overall assurance levels and are expected to be more effective in reducing CSR decoupling. They involve greater scrutiny than limited assurance or assurance restricted to specific sections (Moroney et al. 2012), decrease the likelihood that management will selectively highlight favorable CSR performance while omitting less favorable aspects (Cho et al. 2012), and are more likely to signal that the CSR information is fairly presented, in all material respects. However, they are also costly signals. According to signaling theory, companies will trade off the relative costs and benefits of different assurance combinations and employ combinations only if the expected benefits outweigh the costs (Connelly et al. 2011; Hahn and Reimsbach 2021). The marginal expected benefits of credibly signaling lower levels of CSR decoupling through \u2018high-quality' assurance choices are more likely to outweigh the associated incremental costs for companies with low levels of CSR decoupling than for those with high CSR decoupling. Particularly for large firms that attract much public attention and scrutiny, the expected benefits of enhanced stakeholder confidence in the credibility of the CSR information disclosed may likely outweigh the higher costs, including the increased CSR assurance expenses (Braam and Peeters 2018; Fonseca 2010). In addition, these \u2018high-quality' assurance choices are challenging for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling to imitate (Clarkson et al. 2008; Pflugrath et al. 2011; e.g. Connelly et al. 2011).\n\nLegitimacy theory, however, suggests that companies exhibiting high levels of CSR decoupling may also benefit from CSR assurance, especially when faced with public pressure and legitimacy threats. Specifically, these companies are more likely to choose \u201clow-quality\u201d assurance choices, that is, limited assurance and a narrow scope, resulting in less scrutiny and greater flexibility to decouple reported CSR performance from actual practices. Through these strategic assurance choices, managers can signal the credibility and reliability of their CSR disclosures while simultaneously masking high levels of CSR decoupling. As a result, for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling, CSR assurance can actively help manage stakeholders' confidence in the company's commitment to sustainable development (Schons and Steinmeier 2016). Strategic CSR assurance choices can help to divert attention from unfavorable CSR performance, while at the same time enhancing perceived legitimacy and corporate reputation (Hahn and L\u00fclfs 2014; Michelon et al. 2015; Roszkowska-Menkes et al. 2024).\n\nWe expect that companies with low levels of CSR decoupling are more likely to select combinations of reasonable assurance and a broader scope to differentiate themselves from companies with high levels of CSR decoupling. Combinations of \u201chigh-quality\u201d assurance choices are costly signals but provide strategic benefits for companies with low levels of CSR decoupling because they are difficult for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling to imitate. In particular, for large firms that attract much public attention and scrutiny, the marginal expected benefits of credibly signaling lower levels of CSR decoupling are likely to outweigh the associated marginal costs of using these combinations. In contrast, companies with high levels of CSR decoupling may strategically use combinations of the \u201clow-quality assurance choices\u201d, that is, limited assurance with a narrow scope, to signal credibility while simultaneously obscuring the extent of their CSR decoupling. Accordingly, we state the following hypotheses:\n\n### Hypothesis 1.\n\nCompanies that combine a reasonable level of assurance with a broad scope of assurance on their CSR reports exhibit less CSR decoupling than companies lacking either or both of these assurance choices.\n\nFollowing prior literature, we distinguish between assurance providers from the auditing profession and other independent providers, such as sustainability or environmental consulting firms (Velte 2021; Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero and Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez 2018; Sethi et al. 2017). The auditing profession has experience and developed auditing standards, a body of ethics, independence and ethical requirements, that is, generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), and quality control mechanisms to provide high-quality independent assurance. Unlike other independent service providers, who are not required to comply with GAAP, having to follow GAAPs ensures a higher and more consistent quality of assurance for CSR reports, which enhances stakeholder trust. Auditing firms also have a reputation on which they rely on for the continuation of their business. For these reasons, some literature argues that assurance provided by auditing firms, on average, is of a higher quality than that provided by\nspecialist consultants (Hodge et al. 2009; Pflugrath et al. 2011; Zorio et al. 2013).\n\nMoreover, studies indicate that assurance providers from the auditing profession tend to charge higher fees than non-auditing providers (e.g. Simnett et al. 2009). This is consistent with the literature suggesting that fees may serve as a proxy for the level of audit effort (Hoitash et al. 2007). In this context, assurance providers from the auditing profession, on average, are likely to signal a higher level of audit effort on CSR reports than their non-audit counterparts (Dalla Via and Perego 2020). As a result, they are expected to be more effective in reducing CSR decoupling, enhancing credibility, and shaping stakeholders' perceptions of the reliability of the information disclosed in CSR reports. A counterargument, however, is that non-auditing assurance providers, such as environmental or sustainability consultancies, may possess more specialized expertise (Velte 2021; Martinez-Ferrero et al. 2018) and may adopt a different focus compared to traditional auditors (O'Dwyer and Owen 2005). Assurance providers within the auditing profession, however, can acquire this specialized knowledge (Simnett et al. 2009; Casey and Grenier 2015).\n\nWhen considering CSR assurance combinations that include the choice of an assurance provider, the arguments become less straightforward. For both companies with high and low levels of CSR decoupling, selecting an assurance provider from the auditing profession may offer benefits. For companies with low levels of CSR decoupling, an assurance provider from the auditing profession can strengthen the effects of a CSR assurance approach that provides a reasonable level of assurance and/or a broad scope, thereby enhancing the credibility of their CSR disclosures. Conversely, for companies with high levels of CSR decoupling, an assurance provider from the auditing profession can also strengthen the effectiveness of \u201clow-quality\u201d assurance options, building legitimacy and facilitating stakeholder trust.\n\nTaken together, given that assurance providers from the auditing profession have well-established, high-quality assurance processes and rely on their reputation\u2014to a higher extent than non-auditing assurors\u2014we state the following hypothesis:\n\n### Hypothesis 2.\n\nCompanies with a reasonable level of assurance on their CSR reports provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession exhibit less CSR decoupling compared to companies lacking either or both of these assurance choices.\n\n### Hypothesis 3.\n\nCompanies with a broad scope of assurance on their CSR reports provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession exhibit less CSR decoupling compared to companies lacking either or both of these assurance choices.\n\n## Research Method\n\n### Sample\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we first extracted data on nonfinancial information from the Sustainability Disclosure Database, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and LSEG Workspace. When non-financial information was not available in these databases, CSR reports were retrieved directly from the companies' websites to gather the missing data. We then merged this data with financial data provided by LSEG Workspace Datastream. Our final dataset contains 4299 firm-year observations in 843 unique publicly listed firms across 29 different countries in the period 2010--2022.\n\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for these firms. Panel A reports the distribution of the sample firms across countries and industries. Almost half of the firms are from the United Kingdom and United States, which are both shareholder-oriented countries; data coverage is, in general, large. However, we also cover smaller countries, containing two to eight firms. Panel B presents the distribution of CSR assurance choices across industries and shows the distribution of CSR assurance choices across sectors, with the manufacturing sector accounting for 43% of observations. Panel C shows the distribution of CSR assurance choices by year for the subsample of firms with CSR assurance.\n\n### Variables\n\n### CSR Decoupling\n\nTo measure our dependent variable CSR decoupling (CSR DECOUPLING), we follow the approach of Hawn and Ioannou (2016), who\u2014using raw data points from the Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database (currently part of the ESG database in LSEG Workspace)\u2014differentiated between external and internal CSR actions. Actions were classified as external CSR actions if they \u201c[...] appeared to be more externally oriented in terms of disclosure (e.g. reporting) and claims [...],\u201d while internal actions were those \u201c[...] that were more internally oriented in terms of policies [...]\u201d (Hawn and Ioannou 2016, 2577). Following Hawn and Ioannou (2016), we first measured external and internal actions per firm per year as the equally-weighted average of the normalized performance scores of internal actions and external actions, respectively. However, in our study, we make use of the LSEG database, where not all data points used to construct the original 24 external and 21 internal actions remain available. Where necessary, we substituted missing data with adapted measures or the most appropriate available proxies. Additionally, we omitted two external actions to avoid potential duplication with variables already included in our model as independent and control variables. The indices were then normalized, resulting in annual firm-level measures ranging from 0 to 1. Following Hawn and Ioannou (2016), CSR decoupling was calculated as the difference between the external normalized score in year t and the internal normalized score in year t - 1, where higher values indicate more CSR decoupling. Because larger companies are expected to have higher levels of internal and external CSR actions, we also applied a scaled measure for CSR decoupling. Consistent with Hawn and Ioannou (2016), this size-adjusted, relative measure of CSR decoupling was calculated as the ratio of CSR decoupling to the natural logarithm of total assets. This approach aligns with prior studies that also applied a scaled measures of CSR performance and disclosure (AlTuwaijri et al. 2004; Cho and Patten 2007; Clarkson et al. 2008; Braam et al. 2016).\nTABLE 1 | Descriptive statistics for sample firms (2009-2022).\n\nPanel A.

SCOPE is equal to 1 if the scope of the CSR assurance provided covers the entire sustainability report, and 0 otherwise. PROVIDER takes the value of 1 if the assurance provider is a member of the auditing profession, and 0 if the assurance is not provided by a member of the auditing profession (Simnett et al. 2009; Sethi et al. 2017; Martinez-Ferrero et al. 2018).\n\n# 3.2.3 | Control Variables\n\nAt the firm level, consistent with prior studies, we included size (SIZE) measured as the natural logarithm of total assets,\n\nleverage (LEVERAGE) defined as the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, return on assets (ROA) measured as the return-on-assets ratio (Ruiz-Blanco et al. 2022; Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2022; Sauerwald and Su 2019), and other firm-specific characteristics (Tashman et al. 2019; Marquis et al. 2016). For non-financial performance, we used the ESG score (ESG) provided by the ESG database from LSEG Workspace Datastream, which reflects a company's combined performance across the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars. Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D), defined as the expenses in research and development divided by the total sales (Tashman et al. 2019), was added as a proxy for a firm's innovation ability. To overcome the common issue of missing data on firms' R&amp;D expenses, we followed Tashman et al. (2019) by using industry averages as a proxy for missing data. Capital intensity (CAPITAL INTENSITY), measured as the ratio of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets (Marquis et al. 2016;\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 2025\nTABLE 2 | Variable definitions.\n\n|  Dependent variables  |   |\n| --- | --- |\n|  CSR DECOUPLINGit | Calculated as the difference between the external normalized score in year t and the internal normalized score in year t-1 for firm i in year t. Higher values indicate more CSR decoupling.  |\n|  SCALED CSR DECOUPLINGit | Relative, size-adjusted measure of CSR decoupling calculated as the ratio of CSR decoupling to the natural logarithm of total assets for firm i in year t.  |\n|  Independent variables  |   |\n|  CSR ASSURANCEit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the sustainability report of firm i in year t was assured by an independent CSR assurance provider, and 0 otherwise.  |\n|  LEVELit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if reasonable assurance was provided for the sustainability report of firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise, that is, limited assurance.  |\n|  SCOPEit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the scope of the independent assurance provided covers the entire sustainability report of firm i in year t, and 0 otherwise.  |\n|  PROVIDERit | A dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the assurance provider of firm i in year t is a member of the auditing profession, and 0 if the assurance is not provided by an accounting firm (Simnett et al. 2009).  |\n|  Control variables at firm and country level  |   |\n|  SIZEit | Natural logarithm of the company i's year-end total assets.  |\n|  LEVERAGEit | Total debt for firm i in year t, measured as a percentage of total assets.  |\n|  ROAit-1 | Return on assets for firm i in year t-1, measured as net income divided by total assets.  |\n|  ESGit | Combined ESG score for firm i in year t, based on the reported information in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars as obtained from the ESG database in LSEG Workspace.  |\n|  R&Dit | Proxy for innovation, measured as the expenses in research and development divided by total sales for firm i in year t (Tashman et al. 2019).  |\n|  CAPITAL INTENSITYit | Ratio of net property, plant, and equipment to total assets for firm i in year t (Marquis et al. 2016; Tashman et al. 2019).  |\n|  DISCLOSURE REGULATIONit | Dummy variable coded as 1 if a company i in year t has to comply with mandatory CSR disclosure regulation (Krueger et al. 2024), and 0 other wise.  |\n|  STAKEHOLDER ORIENTATIONi | Dummy variable coded as 1 if a company i is headquartered in a stakeholder-oriented country, and 0 if a company i is headquartered in a shareholder-oriented or other country.  |\n\nTashman et al. 2019), was included because capital-intensive firms typically have greater financial resources, which may influence their approach to CSR initiatives and assurance practices. In addition, we controlled for whether firms were subject to mandatory CSR disclosure regulations (Krueger et al. 2024).\n\nTo control for sector-specific effects, we controlled for industry differences based on a categorization of industries with the use of the two-digit SIC codes (Industry dummies). To account for country-level effects, we distinguished between companies that were headquartered in a stakeholder-oriented versus shareholder-oriented and other countries (Ballou et al. 2018; Braam and Peeters 2018; Simnett et al. 2009). Table 2\n\nsummarizes the definitions of the dependent, explanatory, and control variables used in our analyses. Table 3 presents the summary statistics for these variables.\n\n# 3.3 | Research Model\n\nWe tested our hypotheses using multilevel mixed-effects linear panel data regression analyses as our panel data set has a multilevel structure with repeated measurements at the firm level that are nested within countries. This approach accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and mitigates the risk of heteroscedasticity (Lindner et al. 2021). To test Hypotheses 1-3, we used the following model:\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 2025\nTABLE 3 | Summary statistics.\n\n|  Panel A.

We used one-year lagged effects for the CSR assurance-related choices as the influence of the CSR assurance practices might not immediately affect CSR decoupling, and thus approach causality. To\n\naccount for the fact that the lagged effects of CSR assurance-related options on CSR decoupling may vary depending on the presence of the other assurance-related choices, we examined the interaction effects between different assurance-related choices. Finally, our panel data analysis incorporated year fixed effects to control for time effects and random effects at both the firm and country levels to control for variations across firms and countries. The Pearson's $r$ correlations shown in Panel B of Table 3 as well as the variance inflation factors (unreported) suggest no multicollinearity.\n\n## 4 | Results\n\n### 4.1 | Tests of Hypotheses\n\nTable 4 shows the results of the regression analysis that examines the relationships between the combinations of the CSR assurance choices and CSR decoupling to test Hypotheses 1-3.

In both panels, Models 1 and 3 use the size-adjusted, scaled measure of CSR decoupling as the dependent variable, while Models 2 and 4 use the gap measure of CSR decoupling.\n\nModels 2 and 4 in both Panel A and B show that the interactions between the lagged effects of LEVEL and SCOPE are significantly and negatively associated with CSR decoupling. These results provide strong support for Hypothesis 1, indicating that companies providing a reasonable level of assurance combined with a broad scope of assurance on their CSR reports exhibit less CSR decoupling than companies lacking one or both of these assurance characteristics. The findings suggest that the combination of reasonable assurance with a broad assurance scope can have synergistic effects in reducing CSR decoupling.\n\nModels 2 and 4 in both Panels also reveal that the interactions between the lagged effects of LEVEL and PROVIDER are significantly and negatively related to CSR decoupling. These results provide strong support for Hypothesis 2, indicating that companies combining a reasonable level of assurance with assurance provided by the auditing profession exhibit lower levels of CSR decoupling.\n\nFinally, Model 4 in Panel A and Models 2 and 4 in Panel B show significant positive interactions between SCOPE and PROVIDER and CSR decoupling, while Model 2 in Panel A shows a positive but non-significant association. These results do not support Hypothesis 3. Specifically, the findings in Panel B suggest that among companies with CSR assurance on their reports, those with limited assurance, a broad assurance scope, and an assurance provider from the auditing profession exhibit higher levels of CSR decoupling.\n\nTogether, these results suggest that CSR assurance practices that exceed minimum standards, particularly those involving reasonable assurance, can play a significant role in mitigating CSR decoupling. The findings suggest that CSR assurance can conditionally contribute to mitigating CSR decoupling and enhance the quality of CSR reports. Specifically, the findings indicate that the assurance process enhances the quality of CSR reports when a reasonable level of assurance is combined with a broad scope or assurance providers from the auditing profession.\n\n## Robustness\n\nThe results in Table 4 show that using the alternative measures of CSR decoupling does not change our main results, suggesting that the findings are robust across different measures of CSR decoupling. In addition, we investigated whether cross-country variation measures may affect the results. For this reason, we also estimated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions with country, industry, and year fixed effects and firm-level clustered and heteroscedasticity-adjusted standard errors. Table 5 presents the results of these additional analyses, which qualitatively align with our main analysis in Table 4, indicating that the findings are robust to different measures of country effects.\n\nMoreover, Table 1 shows that the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) are highly represented in our data set with 26% and 22% of observations, respectively, while some other countries in the sample are rather small. To ensure that our results are not influenced by the inclusion (or exclusion) of the UK or the US, or by observations from countries that are very small, as additional robustness tests, we recursively repeated our main analyses after eliminating the UK, the US, one at a time, or the small country samples containing less than 15 firm-year observations from the analysis. Table 6 reports the results of these additional analyses for the main results. The results are consistent with the main results in Table 4, indicating that the results are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of specific countries with the larger or smaller country samples.\n\nTable 7 shows the results when also including the three-way interaction between LEVEL, SCOPE, and PROVIDER. The findings of this additional analysis show that the results are mostly robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the three-way interaction. Finally, even though we use time-fixed effects in our settings, we test whether the Covid pandemic drives our main results by dropping the Covid years 2020 and 2021 from our sample. The untabulated results show that our main findings stay qualitatively the same after dropping the Covid years. Overall, as none of the robustness tests change our general results, we are confident that our results are qualitatively robust.\n\n## Conclusions and Discussion\n\nThis study examined the relationship between CSR assurance and CSR decoupling. Specifically, we explored how the combinations of the level and scope of assurance and the type of assurance provider are associated with a reduction in CSR decoupling. Our findings indicate that CSR assurance can mitigate CSR decoupling when reasonable assurance is combined with a broad scope or when reasonable assurance is provided by an assurance provider from the auditing profession. They highlight the importance of comprehensive assurance practices in effectively addressing the gap between CSR disclosure and performance, and in substantively enhancing the quality of CSR reports. However, for companies that meet only the minimum assurance standards, our results suggest that CSR assurance primarily serves a symbolic role, enhancing perceived legitimacy while having little effect on reduction, or even potentially increasing CSR decoupling. Legitimacy theory explains these latter findings by suggesting that managers of companies use CSR assurance as a self-serving tool for risk and impression management to proactively shape stakeholders' perceptions of the credibility of the CSR information disclosed, enhance perceived company legitimacy, and build stakeholder trust (Talbot and Boiral 2018; Braam and Peeters 2018; O'Dwyer et al. 2011).\n\nOur results have important implications for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. From a policy perspective, they suggest that policymakers should strengthen mandatory CSR assurance requirements to enhance the quality of corporate sustainability reporting. Under the CSRD, companies are currently mandated to obtain limited assurance (European Commission 2025). However, our findings indicate that limited assurance\u2014regardless of its scope or whether it is provided by\na practitioner from the auditing profession\u2014does not reduce CSR decoupling, nor does it increase the likelihood that CSR disclosures are fairly presented and free from material misstatements. Specifically, the results suggest that limited assurance\u2014whether mandatory or voluntary\u2014may primarily serve a symbolic rather than substantive role, as its actual impact on the quality and reliability of CSR disclosures appears limited. Accordingly, the decision of EU policymakers to drop the ambitious goal to implement reasonable assurance of CSR information under the Omnibus regulation raises concerns that, despite growing societal demands for corporate accountability and transparency regarding CSR performance and corporate impact on society and the environment, limited assurance may produce unintended adverse effects (Aboud et al. 2024). However, such an approach entails substantial costs and implementation challenges, which lie beyond the scope of this study.\n\nOur findings can further be helpful for investors and other stakeholders in assessing the credibility and reliability of the CSR information presented in CSR reports. Our findings suggest that CSR assurance is not \"automatically\" associated with management's commitment to credible CSR disclosures, increased transparency, and a higher CSR reporting quality (Michelon et al. 2015).\n\nFinally, our study has certain limitations, including those related to the potential influence of unobservable factors that may affect CSR assurance and CSR decoupling, potentially leading to endogeneity issues. Although we have included different measures of CSR decoupling and conducted several robustness tests, future studies could further investigate the conditions under which CSR assurance enhances or inhibits the development of higher-quality CSR reporting and increased transparency, ultimately facilitating more responsible business practices. Additionally, future studies could examine the cost implications of CSR assurance, including those related to the assurance level, scope, and the choice of assurance provider to advance our understanding of the consequences of regulating CSR assurance.\n\n# Endnotes"

While it can improve a firm's public image and potentially enhance its financial performance, it may also lead to increased risk and misallocation of resources. Greenwashing firms have a lower weighted average cost of capital due to a higher debt-to-capital ratio. They are larger, have higher institutional ownership, and lower dividend yields. On the other hand, greenwashing firms have more ESG-related controversies that can hurt firm revenues and market value, they have higher unsystematic risk, and they have lower dividend yields and return on equity. I also find evidence that there is a feedback relationship between ESG ratings and greenwashing. There is no evidence that government mandates on ESG reporting inhibit greenwashing. The implication is that ESG scoring that emphasizes reporting ESG activities while informing investors also encourages greenwashing.\n\nKeywords: greenwashing; systematic risk; unsystematic risk; ESG; resource allocation\n\ncheck for updates\n\nCitation: Gregory, Richard Paul. 2024.

Introduction\n\nA 2022 Harris Poll, surveying 1491 executives, revealed that a striking 80% rated their organizations' environmental initiatives as above average. However, 58% conceded that green hypocrisy is prevalent, acknowledging that their companies have exaggerated their sustainability efforts (Google Cloud 2022).\n\nThe term greenwashing was first used by environmentalist Jay Westervelt in a 1986 essay promoting towel reuse in the hospitality industry (Pearson 2010; Wolniak and H\u00e5bek 2015; Guo et al. 2018). There is no generally accepted definition of the term greenwashing. The concept remains ambiguous (Seele and Gatti 2017).\n\nMany researchers (Ramus and Montiel 2005; Gillespie 2008; Stamoulakis and Bridwell 2009; Vos 2009; Furlow 2010; Mitchell and Ramey 2011) use the Oxford English Dictionary definition: \"disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image\". Others use the definition of the organization Greenpeace: \"the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benefits of a product or service\" (Fliegelman 2009; Parguel et al. 2009, 2011; Gallicano 2011; Delmas and Cuerel Burbano 2011; Chen and Chang 2013).\n\nde Freitas Netto et al. (2020) identify types of greenwashing based on a systemic review from 2010 to 2020. Selective disclosure is when firms do not disclose negative environmental information and promote positive information. Decoupling behavior is when the firm uses symbolic actions to deflect attention to minor issues or issues it can control. The signaling of corporate pragmatic legitimacy is when corporations signal that they are meeting environmental goals they have failed to meet.\n\nIn this paper, I adopt a view where the level of effort of a firm in advertising and reporting its ESG activities is at variance with its level of effort in actual ESG activities as\n\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526. https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm17110526\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/jrfm\na measure of greenwashing. This is a broad measure of greenwashing, as it ignores that a firm may not have to put as much effort as another firm to be ESG compliant. It also, unfortunately, mixes several previous definitions of greenwashing into one measure as well as captures legitimate information that may be helpful to consumers and investors. Thus, it is a noisy measure.\n\nGreenwashing of course presents a host of problems to the market. For investors, it hides risks that the company is exposed to, thus leading them to undercharge capital and subsequently leading to inefficient allocation of capital. For consumers, it leads to misallocation of consumption and misallocation of personal investment.\n\nDespite the voluminous literature on greenwashing, there have previously been few attempts at estimating the effects of greenwashing on the financial aspects of firms. The previous research has concentrated primarily on the effect of greenwashing on the market value of the firm's shares. Walker and Wan (2012), Du (2015), Testa et al. (2018a), and Ghitti et al. (2020) all find that greenwashing decreases the value of a greenwashing firm's stock shares. The reason for this is not clear. Zhang (2022a) finds that greenwashing activities by firms are associated with the firms being financially constrained. Kim and Lyon (2015) find that greenwashing is associated with higher profits and increased regulation. Marquis and Toffel (2011, 2012) propose that greenwashing is associated with increased firm size. Gregory (2023) finds that greenwashing is promoted by low stock price volatility, high costs of capital, and high information asymmetry between managers and shareholders.\n\nThe previous research has been limited in exploring the effects of greenwashing on financial metrics because the greenwashing measure used is an endogenous variable. I use a methodology that addresses this based on the errors-in-variables technique proposed by Griliches and Hausman (1986). By treating the Greenwash score used here as an endogenous variable, and realizing it is negatively correlated with the error term, this reveals a much richer and accurate set of results.\n\nIn this research, I examine the financial outcomes of greenwashing by constructing a greenwashing index using Refinitiv ESG component scores. I find that overall, the results suggest that greenwashing is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative consequences. While it can improve a firm's public image and potentially enhance its financial performance, it may also lead to increased risk and misallocation of resources. Greenwashing firms have a lower weighted average cost of capital due to a higher debt-to-capital ratio. They are larger, have higher institutional ownership, and lower dividend yields. On the other hand, greenwashing firms have more ESG-related controversies that can hurt firm revenues and market value, they have higher unsystematic risk, and return on equity. I also find evidence that there is a feedback relationship between ESG ratings and greenwashing.\n\nSection 2 details the previous literature. Section 3 describes the materials and methods used in this research. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 presents the conclusion.\n\n## 2. Literature Review\n\n### 2.1. Greenwashing and Public Attitudes\n\nGreenwashing has a long and considerable literature of investigation. Kangun et al. (1991) first address the problems with environmental advertising. They examined 18 periodicals from 1989 to 1990 for environmental advertising. A total of 58% of the environmental ads had at least one misleading claim by expert judges with environmental backgrounds.\n\nCarlson et al. (1993) take a similar approach with environmental ads using MBA students guided by a matrix typology. The judges found 60% of the environmental ads to be misleading.\n\nManrai et al. (1997) investigate \u201cgreen-claims\u201d and country disposition. Moderate claims of greenness led to more favorable product evaluations than stronger claims. Country development also had a positive effect on product evaluation.\nNewell et al. (1998) examine the effects of misleading environmental claims on consumer perceptions of ads. They find that higher perceived deception leads to less corporate credibility. They find that higher deception results in less favorable attitudes toward the ad. Higher levels of perceived deception also lead to less favorable attitudes toward the brand. And higher deception results in decreased purchase intentions. Greer and Bruno (1996) provided a detailed study of the misleading environmental claims of twenty corporations and their actual environmental performance.\n\nK\u00e4rn\u00e4 et al. (2001) investigate if green advertising reflects sound decisions in the Finnish forestry industry. They find that in general, the advertisements reflect the company's environmental decisions.\n\nLaufer (2003) argues that corporate ESG reporting has many parallels with financial reporting. Greenwashing here is a form of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. This shifts the risk of social non-compliance from management onto shareholders and consumers. Laufer notes the inadequacy of reporting standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to address this moral hazard. He argues for the need for independent auditors of ESG performance, like that which prevails in financial reporting.\n\nBazillier and Vauday (2009) view corporate social responsibility and advertising as strategic complements. They explore unsubstantiated claims in a theoretical and empirical framework. They find that advertising effort has a positive effect on the level of corporate social responsibility.\n\nChen and Chang (2013) research the effect of greenwashing on consumer perceptions. They find that greenwashing decreases trust in companies. This leads to greater consumer confusion. They also find that greenwashing increases the perceived risk of a company's products.\n\nNyilasy et al. (2014) investigate the effects of green advertising and a corporation's environmental performance on brand attitudes and purchase intentions. They find that greater green advertising results in more unfavorable brand attitudes.\n\nChen et al. (2014) research the effect of greenwashing on consumer word-of-mouth advertising of brands. They find that greenwashing hurts perceived quality and satisfaction.\n\nRahman et al. (2015) examine the effect of greenwashing on consumer participation in hotel industry environmental programs. They find greenwashing increases consumer skepticism and decreases participation.\n\nParguel et al. (2015) examine whether evoking nature can mislead consumers about a brand's ecological image. They find that it does, especially if the consumer has low ecological knowledge.\n\nAji and Sutikno (2015) investigate consumer attitudes toward green labeling in Indonesia. They find that greenwashing increases consumer skepticism and perceived risk. However, at the same time, it increases trust.\n\nAkturan (2018) explore the effect of greenwashing on green brand equity. He finds that greenwashing harms green brand associations and brand credibility. He finds that greenwashing indirectly influences green brand equity and purchase intention.\n\nSchmuck et al. (2018) examine the differing effects of vague and deliberately misleading advertising. They find that vague claims do not hurt company brands while misleading claims do.\n\nWang et al. (2019) examine the impact of greenwashing of one brand on the purchase intention of green products from other brands. Further, they test the mediating role of greenwashing perception of the entire industry and the moderating role of brand attitudes towards other brands in the industry. Their results suggest that the greenwashing behavior of one brand negatively affects consumers' purchase intention of green products from other brands in the industry. Their results also indicate that the greenwashing perception of the entire industry partially mediates the relationship between the greenwashing behavior of a brand and the purchase intention of green products from other brands.\n\nGatti et al. (2019) provide a systematic review of the literature on greenwashing. They find that though greenwashing may be successfully used to influence consumers'\nperceptions about a firm's CSR activities, it carries with it risks of negative effects on consumers' attitudes and financial performance.\n\nExamining the reaction of consumers to greenwashing, Nguyen et al. (2019) demonstrate that greenwashing is negatively associated with green purchase intentions and that green skepticism mediates this negative association.\n\nPimonenko et al. (2020) check the impact of greenwashing on companies' green brands in Ukraine. They find that greenwashing leads to a decline in the company's green brand. They also find that the strongest factor influencing greenwashing is information on the company's official website.\n\nSzabo and Webster (2021) examine the effects of green marketing on environmental and product perceptions. Perceived greenwashing is positively associated with green risk. Greenwashing is negatively associated with green value, brand attitudes, and purchase intentions. Greenwashing is also negatively related to happiness.\n\nThe literature on the effects of greenwashing on the public's attitudes towards companies that greenwash has focused almost entirely on consumer attitudes, with little notice paid to the effects of greenwashing on investor, manager, and employee attitudes. This is a glaring omission.\n\n### 2.2. Drivers of Greenwashing\n\nMunshi and Kurian (2005) examine greenwashing in light of postcolonial theory. They argue that corporate social responsibility is a long-term corporate strategy for social acceptance. It reflects public relations. This is not backed up by actual deeds. Public relations are in an asymmetric hierarchy of relations amongst Western shareholders, the Western public, and Third World citizens who play little role in the hierarchy. This asymmetry allows corporations to talk about ecological aims without giving up their goal of corporate profits.\n\nRamus and Montiel (2005) find low rates of adoption of specific environmental policies. They find that service companies are more likely to commit to environmental policies than to act on them.\n\nVos (2009) argues that greenwashing is a recent strategy for corporations. It arose from the use of marketing to counter environmental regulations that began in the 1970s. He argues this led to appearing environmentally friendly and began to be good for company profitability. This was a shift from the traditional corporate response of denying environmental \u201cunfriendliness\u201d. He makes the case that the strongest reason for greenwashing is economic.\n\nCherry and Sneirson (2010) examine the stark contrast between BP's cultivated green image and its disastrous environmental record. They determine that the reason for greenwashing is a corporate culture based on shareholder primacy.\n\nParguel et al. (2011) examine the effect of a company's corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings on the perceived effect of its corporate communications. A company's CSR rating has a direct effect on the perceived intrinsic motives of the company's communications on ESG issues. So much so, that Parguel et al. propose that ratings may deter greenwashing.\n\nDelmas and Cuerel Burbano (2011) make a systematic analysis of the drivers of greenwashing. They define a greenwashing firm as engaging in two behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about its environmental performance. They list twelve drivers for greenwashing: first, Law and Uncertain Regulatory Environment; second, Activist, NGO, and Media Monitoring; third, Consumer Demand; fourth, Investor Demand; fifth, Competitive Pressure; sixth, Firm Characteristics, such as size, industry, profitability, lifecycle stage, and particular resources and competencies; seventh, Incentive Structure and Culture; eighth, Effectiveness of Intra-Firm Communication; ninth, Organizational Inertia; tenth, Optimistic Bias; eleventh, Narrow Decision Framing; and twelfth, Hyperbolic Intertemporal Discounting. In the conclusion, they also mention limited and imperfect information about environmental performance. They make no distinction about the contribution of these drivers.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\nLyon and Maxwell (2011) consider a theoretical model of a firm's disclosure of environmental information under an environmental auditing firm. They find that while auditing inhibits greenwashing, it also inhibits the firm from reporting some relevant environmental information.\n\nExamining the greenwashing of firms in 46 countries, Marquis and Toffel (2011) find that smaller firms are more likely to greenwash. They also find that more visible firms\u2014those that were larger and did greater environmental damage\u2014were especially less likely to practice selective disclosure in institutional contexts where the government and civil society were more connected to globalization. They find evidence that the global environmental movement is affecting corporate practices.\n\nMarquis and Toffel (2012) examine the characteristics that make firms choose to greenwash. They find that firms elect to do selective disclosure of environmental information when they are large companies but less so when they have a large environmental impact.\n\nWu and Shen (2013) conducted a study of 162 banks in 22 countries. They identify three motives for banks participating in CSR activities. These are strategic choice, altruism, and greenwashing. They find a positive relationship between CSR and various measures of financial performance. This relationship was nonexistent for banks greenwashing their activities while making no substantive changes.\n\nLyon and Montgomery (2013) theorize that the use of social media by external stakeholders decreases the use of greenwashing.\n\nLyon and Montgomery (2015) perform a review of the literature on greenwashing. They define greenwashing as misleading communication. They detail eleven varieties of misleading communication. They also list twelve drivers of greenwashing. They note that the literature is limited on the effects of greenwashing. The effects tend to point to the effects being negative on the firm's financial and market brand.\n\nMarquis et al. (2016) explore when firms are going to engage in selective disclosure. Firms selectively disclose less when they are firms that damage the environment more, especially when they are in countries that have stronger protections for property rights.\n\nBerrone et al. (2017) investigate sources of differences in the impacts of environmental actions. They find environmental actions increase environmental legitimacy. Some actions decrease legitimacy if environmental performance deteriorates. Intense scrutiny from nongovernmental organizations can lead to decreased legitimacy.\n\nSeele and Gatti (2017) find that existing definitions of greenwashing place too much emphasis on misleading. Existing definitions do not incorporate unjust allegations. They propose a revised definition of greenwashing. Greenwashing is the co-creation of an external accusation toward an organization with regard to presenting a misleading green message.\n\nTesta et al. (2018b) explore the influence of institutional pressures on environmental practices. Pressure from suppliers and shareholders contributes to corporate greening. Pressure from customers and industrial associations tends to encourage greenwashing.\n\nde Freitas Netto et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review of the literature to define greenwashing and find its characteristics and forms. In general, there are two competing definitions of greenwashing. First, there is greenwashing as selective disclosure, where firms have poor environmental performance and positive environmental communications. Second, there is greenwashing as decoupling, where corporations make statements to satisfy stakeholders in terms of sustainability but without concrete action. In terms of forms, there are two identified. There is the claim of greenwashing where the company claims a product or brand that is created to make a misleading environmental claim. There is also executional greenwashing, where the company suggests nature-evoking elements in its advertising to suggest that its products or brands are environmentally friendly.\n\nArouri et al. (2021) demonstrate that heightened competition in product markets serves to curtail the practice of greenwashing.\n\nNishitani et al. (2021) investigate whether corporate environmental activities to meet UN sustainable development goals amongst Vietnamese firms are a form of greenwashing.\nThey find that companies that incorporate sustainable development goals are more likely to improve their environmental performance. But this was mediated by the strong government pressure they were under to meet the sustainable development goals.\n\nFerr\u00f3n-V\u00edlchez et al. (2021) research how greenwashing affects managerial behavior. Their findings indicate that managers who perceive greenwashing start to form negative feelings about the greenwasher. This hurts their willingness to start or continue the business relationship with the greenwasher. This is moderated by the \u201cgreen attitude\u201d of the manager, with a higher green attitude leading to less of a relationship.\n\nMbanyele et al. (2022) examine the effects of mandatory CSR reporting on CSR scores, environmental innovation, and quality of innovation. They find that mandatory CSR reporting leads to higher CSR scores. It also leads to greater innovation and quality of innovation. This effect is greatest for firms with weaker corporate governance and weaker CSR disclosure standards before mandatory reporting.\n\nZhang (2022b) examines firm product quality in light of environmental regulation. He finds environmental regulation has a positive effect on product quality for low-pollution firms. There is a negative impact on product quality from environmental regulation for pollution-heavy firms. Financial constraints motivate pollution-heavy firms to decrease their product quality. This promotes greenwashing.\n\nZhang (2022a) creates a peer-relative greenwash score to measure greenwashing by companies. He finds that companies' greenwashing decisions are motivated by financial constraints.\n\nGarc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2022) examine the relationship between Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) certification and greenwashing. They use an international sample of 1939 companies (15,219 observations from 2002 to 2017). They find that GRI certification leads to less greenwashing.\n\nRuiz-Blanco et al. (2022) investigate the characteristics that make a company pursue greenwashing. They provide evidence that companies in environmentally sensitive industries greenwash less than their counterparts in other industries, as well as companies following the GRI guidelines. Companies that issue a sustainability report greenwash less than those that do not. Companies in industries with proximity and high visibility greenwash more than their counterparts.\n\nAccording to Hu et al. (2023), disparities in ESG ratings reveal that firms with heightened internal oversight and significant external investor scrutiny display a reduced, and at times negligible, propensity for corporate greenwashing.\n\nGregory (2023) finds that greenwashing is promoted by low stock price volatility, high costs of capital, and high information asymmetry between managers and shareholders.\n\nThe literature on the drivers of greenwashing has thus far been extensive in terms of quantifiable drivers, with little attention paid to ideological and psychological drivers.\n\n### 2.3. Financial Effects of Greenwashing\n\nWalker and Wan (2012), in a study of top Canadian firms in highly polluting industries, find that greenwashing and symbolic environmental activities by firms harm financial performance. They measure financial performance using return on assets and do not control for endogeneity.\n\nMahoney et al. (2013) examine if standalone company corporate social responsibility reports are a form of greenwashing. They do this by comparing the CSR performance scores of issuers versus non-issuers. They find that companies issuing CSR reports have higher scores. They conclude that issuing reports is not a form of greenwashing.\n\nDu (2015) investigates the market valuation effects of Chinese firms named greenwashing firms. The exposure of greenwashing leads to a significant negative return for the named firms. This effect is found to come from two sources. There is a competitive effect for environmentally friendly firms and a contagious effect for potential environmental wrongdoers.\nKim and Lyon (2015) extend the literature by incorporating the idea of undue modesty by firms in environmental advertising. They call this \u201cbrownwashing\u201d. They then look at the difference in drivers between greenwashing and brownwashing firms. They find that firm growth leads to greenwashing as a result of anticipation of increased interactions with stakeholders in the regulatory environment. They find that deregulation and lower profits lead to brownwashing.\n\nTesta et al. (2018a) analyze the impact of different types of environmental communication strategies on firm value and operating performance using a panel of 3490 publicly traded companies from 58 countries and 19 industries. They find that greenwashing does not pay, whereas brownwashing is associated with lower financial performance.\n\nSun and Zhang (2019) provide an evolutionary game theoretical model of greenwashing, allowing for government regulation. They find that while government regulation can inhibit greenwashing, government tax subsidies will still encourage greenwashing to some extent.\n\nGhitti et al. (2020) propose a measure of greenwashing based on the difference between the Newsweek Green Rankings and the Datastream Environmental, Social, and Governance score. They find that the greenwashing measure negatively affects Tobin's Q estimate and conclude that greenwashing decreases the firm's value in the long run. They also find that the greenwashing variable is negatively affected by corporate board size and whether the firm adheres to Global Reporting Initiative reporting and positively to corporate board independence.\n\nLi et al. (2023) examine the effect of greenwashing on corporate financial performance as measured by return on assets. They used the information on 735 Chinese firms from 2013 to 2017. They find that greenwashing has a positive effect on return on assets. This relationship is weakened by local environmental regulation and reversed by low media favorability.\n\nLi et al. (2023) present evidence that greenwashing exerts a positive influence on corporate financial performance (CFP). However, they note that this effect diminishes under stringent environmental regulations and is entirely negated when media coverage is unfavorable towards firms in China.\n\nIn their 2023 study, Xia and colleagues analyze a cohort of Chinese firms, uncovering compelling evidence that corporations often resort to greenwashing their environmental performance primarily in anticipation of future investment and financing needs. Furthermore, the research reveals a pronounced tendency for companies burdened with higher debt levels to engage in such deceptive practices.\n\nThe literature thus far on the financial effects of greenwashing has focused entirely on the returns side of finance, with little attention paid to risk.\n\n## 3. Materials and Methods\n\n### 3.1. Data\n\nThe ESG data are from Refinitiv. I use the CSRStrategy (a score that reflects a company's practices to communicate that it integrates the economic (financial), social, and environmental dimensions into its day-to-day decision-making processes), Emissions (a score that measures a company's commitment and effectiveness towards reducing environmental emission in the production and operational processes), and ResourceUse (a score that reflects a company's performance and capacity to reduce the use of materials, energy or water, and to find more eco-efficient solutions by improving supply chain management (Thompson Reuters Eikon 2017). I divide the demeaned CSRStrategy score by the mean of the Emissions score and the ResourceUse score. The idea here is that greenwashing firms will advertise their environmental accomplishments more than they act upon them. The definition of greenwashing measured here follows that of de Freitas Netto et al. (2020). It captures all aspects of their three definitions of greenwashing. The variable is then regressed against the overall ESG score for each firm and the error term is taken as the measure of greenwashing. Table 1 gives the basic statistics on the Greenwash score for all\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\n3973 firms in the sample. The sample period is from 2002 to 2022. The firm financial data are from Bloomberg.\n\nTable 1. Greenwash variable and correlation with ESG score and greenwash dummy variables.\n\n|  Statistic | Greenwash  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Mean | 0.4138927  |   |   |   |\n|  Std. dev. | 5.132731  |   |   |   |\n|  Skewness | 49.12677  |   |   |   |\n|  Kurtosis | 3187.111  |   |   |   |\n|  90th percentile | 1.912004  |   |   |   |\n|  75th percentile | 0.5432797  |   |   |   |\n|  25th percentile | -0.6019885  |   |   |   |\n|  Correlations  |   |   |   |   |\n|   | ESG | Greenwash | Greenwash75% | Greenwash25%  |\n|  ESG | 1.0000 |  |  |   |\n|  Greenwash | -0.0014 | 1.0000 |  |   |\n|  Greenwash75% | -0.0102 | 0.2758 | 1.0000 |   |\n|  Greenwash25% | 0.2767 | -0.1458 | -0.1182 | 1.0000  |\n\nGreenwash is the greenwashing variable constructed by dividing the demeaned Refinitiv CSRStrategy score by the arithmetic mean of the Refinitiv Emissions score and the ResourceUse score. Greenwash25% is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash variable is lesser than or equal to -0.6019885, and 0 otherwise. Greenwash75% is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash variable is greater or equal to 0.5432797, and 0 otherwise. ESG is the Refinitiv ESG score. The correlation coefficients are Pearson correlation coefficients.\n\nTo further refine the process, I create two dummy variables. Greenwash  $75\\%$ , which takes on a value of 1 if the firm has a Greenwash score of 0.5432797 or greater, and 0 otherwise. This is taken as representing greenwashing firms. Greenwash  $25\\%$ , which takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash score is less than or equal to  $-0.6019885$ , and 0 otherwise. This represents \"brownwashing\" firms. Brownwashing firms are firms whose environmental activities are not overly promoted.\n\nTo give some idea of the appropriateness of the classification, consider the case of Volkswagen in 2015. The data for the Greenwash variable would have come out in the first part of the year. Based on Volkswagen's scores, the firm would have a Greenwash score of 1.23. This means it would be in the Greenwash  $75\\%$  category. Volkswagen followed an aggressive growth strategy. The company expected to triple its sales in the US with the promotion of clean diesel technology (Muller 2013). In September 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused Volkswagen of defrauding emission tests through software installed on its cars (Davenport and Ewing 2015). Volkswagen admitted to cheating on 11 million diesel vehicles around the world to circumvent emissions tests in the USA and elsewhere. Internal changes in manufacturing led to an improvement in their Greenwash score in 2016 of 0.62, still in the Greenwash  $75\\%$  set, but improving.\n\nTable 2 gives a breakdown of the firms by developed and emerging markets as defined by Morgan Stanley.\n\nTable 2 shows little difference in the proportion of emerging market firms for Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms versus Greenwash  $25\\%$  firms. The t-test statistic on the two means has a value of 1.347, which is significant at the  $18\\%$  level. However, examination of the sample statistics shows that the Greenwash scores of developed market firms exhibit a larger positive skewness and a larger kurtosis than the emerging market firm sample (Skewness Developed Markets: 5.32; Skewness Emerging Markets: 2.15; Kurtosis Developed Markets: 89.04; Kurtosis Emerging Markets: 10.4). Huang et al. (2020) argue that emerging markets are more conducive to greenwashing. I do not find support for that here.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\nTable 2.

Greenwash is the greenwashing variable constructed by dividing the demeaned Refinitiv CSRStrategy score by the arithmetic mean of the Refinitiv Emissions score and the ResourceUse score. Greenwash  $75\\%$  is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash variable is greater or equal to 0.5432797; Greenwash  $25\\%$  is a dummy variable, which takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash score is less than or equal to  $-0.6019885$ , and 0 otherwise.\n\nTable 3 exhibits the division of the firms by Bloomberg industrial sector.\nTable 3.

Greenwash  $75\\%$  is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash variable is greater or equal to 0.5432797; Greenwash  $25\\%$  is a dummy variable, which takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash score is less than or equal to  $-0.6019885$ , and 0 otherwise.\n\nTable 3 shows that Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms are more likely in the sectors of consumer staples, energy, industrial, information technology, materials, and utilities, all of which impact environmentally sensitive areas. This is in contrast to the results of Ruiz-Blanco et al. (2022). The representation of greenwashing firms in all industrial sectors is rather striking. I do not find evidence that service firms are more likely to over-promote their ESG activities. This contradicts the results of Ramus and Montiel (2005).\n\nTable 4 presents the financial and control variables used in this study.\n\nThere are some differences in the means between the Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms and the Greenwash  $25\\%$  firms. First, Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms have a lower weighted average cost of capital. There seems to be no difference in the individual component costs of capital. The difference in the debt-to-capital ratio may explain this. Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms have a higher debt-to-capital ratio. This means they may be using a greater ratio of less expensive debt financing to lower their weighted average cost of capital. Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms tend to be larger, as shown by the market cap and net cap exp figures. Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms also have a higher percentage of institutional ownership. Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms have a lower dividend yield on average and a higher prs score, indicating that they are located in countries with less political risk. Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms exhibit less idiosyncratic risk than Greenwash  $25\\%$  firms as shown by the standard deviations of their stock returns (sd). Table 5 exhibits the means of the Refinitiv component scores for the Greenwash  $75\\%$  and Greenwash  $25\\%$  firms.\n\nThere is no significant difference in the ESG scores between the two samples. Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms have higher Controversies scores than non-Greenwash  $75\\%$  firms. By\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\ndesign, Greenwash75% is higher in CSRStrategy and lower in Emissions and ResourceUse. Greenwash75% firms and Greenwash25% firms have similar means in Management scores. Greenwash75% firms are in significant deficits in the remaining scores. This indicates that Greenwash75% firms not only fail to adhere to advertised environmental goals. They also fail to adhere to social and governance goals. The reason they do not differ in ESG scores may be due to over-emphasis in weighting on CSRStrategy in the overall ESG by the Refinitiv methodology.\n\nTable 4.

Greenwash25% is a dummy variable, which takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash score is less than or equal to  $-0.6019885$ , and 0 otherwise. Greenwash75% is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash variable is greater or equal to 0.5432797, and 0 otherwise. Cod is the after-tax cost of debt = pre-tax cost of debt (1 - tax rate). The average effective tax rate for the sector is used for this computation. Coe1 is estimated using the capital asset pricing model: cost of equity = risk-free rate + beta (risk premium). The average beta for the sector is used. I use the long-term treasury bond rate as the risk-free rate and a  $5.5\\%$  risk premium. Coe2 is the dividend yield of the stock plus the reinvestment rate times the roe. Wacc is the market-weighted cod and coe1. Roe is the net income divided by the book value of equity. Fcff = EBIT(1-t) - (capital expenditures - depreciation) - change in non-cash working capital. Tobin's Q is estimated using the methodology of Peters and Taylor (2017). Beta is estimated by regressing weekly returns on stock against the local index using 5 years of data. Capitalized R&amp;D is R&amp;D expenses amortized over five years at the cost of capital. Cash is Cash and Marketable Securities reported in the balance sheet. Debt to capital is the market value of debt divided by the market value of debt plus the market value of equity. Institutions is the shares held by institutions/shares outstanding. Liquidity is the average number of shares traded divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market cap is the estimated market value of shares outstanding, obtained by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the share price. Net cap exp is capital expenditures - depreciation. Prs is the political risk variable for the home country from ICRG. Sd is the standard deviation of daily stock returns over the year. Fcfe = net income - (capital expenditures - depreciation) - change in non-cash working capital - (principal repaid - new debt issued). *, **, and *** show significance at the  $10\\%$ ,  $5\\%$  and  $1\\%$  level respectively. t-stat te/st is for mean difference between the top quartile based on the Greenwashing variable versus the bottom quartile based on the greenwashing variable.\n\nTable 5.

Significance is signified by *, **, and *** at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Greenwash25% is a dummy variable, which takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash score is less than or equal to -0.6019885, and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn the preceding analysis, there is the question of whether the greenwashing variable is interrelated with the ESG variable. To test this, panel Granger causality tests were run. The results are presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6 shows that there is some concern that ESG scores cause the Greenwash variable. The ESG score does not Granger-cause the Greenwash75% dummy variable at the 5% significance level. The ESG score does Granger-cause the Greenwash25% level, causing some concerns about the interpretation of the Greenwash25% variable.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\nTable 6.

Main Methodology\n\nThere are three problems with the Greenwash variable that must be addressed. The first problem is endogeneity. The data underlying the ESG data are produced within the firm and are thus endogenous to it; therefore, we have to treat the associated Greenwash scores as endogenous variables also. Fortunately, this problem can be overcome with GMM estimation using instrumental variables.\n\nThe second problem, as noted in the introduction, is that the Greenwash variable has a noise component that is not traditionally dealt with in the literature. In applying GMM to the observed variables, the estimates are likely to be biased by the correlation of the ESG variables with the left-out individual effects and because of the negative correlation between the observed ESG variables and the disturbance term (Griliches and Hausman 1986). To overcome this, I use an EIV-type GMM estimator proposed by Griliches and Hausman (1986). In both instances, I control for industry, year, and country effects.\n\nTo illustrate the estimator employed, consider a simple model where the Greenwash score  $= x$  and the dependent variable  $= y$ . Ideally, we would like to measure the true Greenwash score  $z$ , but we cannot because some of the information has been imputed, so we are left with  $x$ . Ideally, I would like to regress as follows:\n\n$$\ny _ {i t} = \\alpha_ {i} + \\beta z _ {i t} + \\eta_ {i t} \\tag {1}\n$$\n\nBut due to the imputation of data, I observe the following:\n\n$$\nx _ {i t} = z _ {i t} + v _ {i t} \\tag {2}\n$$\n\nwhere  $v_{it}$  is a noise term i.i.d. with variance  $\\sigma_v^2$ . If I apply unadjusted estimators to  $y$  on  $x$ , I get the following:\n\n$$\ny _ {i t} = \\underline {{\\alpha}} + \\beta x _ {i t} - \\beta v _ {i t} + \\eta_ {i t} + (\\alpha_ {i} - \\underline {{\\alpha}}) \\tag {3}\n$$\n\nPanel data estimation can help eliminate some of the bias by differencing and going within by looking at the plims of the two estimators as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname {p l i m b} _ {d} = \\beta \\left(1 - \\frac {2 \\sigma_ {v} ^ {2}}{\\operatorname {v a r} (d x)}\\right) \\tag {4}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname {p l i m b} _ {w} = \\beta \\left(1 - \\frac {T - 1}{T} \\frac {\\sigma_ {v} ^ {2}}{\\operatorname {v a r} (\\widetilde {x})}\\right) \\tag {5}\n$$\n\nwhere  $dx = x_{it} - x_{it-1}$  and  $\\widetilde{x} = x_{it} - \\underline{x}$ , and similarly for other variables. Griliches and Hausman (1986) then note with computation of (4) and (5) that the investigator has the necessary ingredients to solve for the unknown  $\\sigma_v^2$  and  $\\beta$  as follows:\n\n$$\n\\beta = \\left[ \\frac {2 b _ {w}}{v a r (d x)} - (T - 1) b _ {d} / T v a r (\\widetilde {x}) \\right] / \\left[ \\frac {2}{v a r (d x)} - (T - 1) / T v a r (\\widetilde {x}) \\right] \\tag {6}\n$$\n$\\sigma_{v}^{2}=\\frac{(\\beta-b_{d})var(dx)}{2\\beta}$ (7)\n\nThe main relationships to be estimated are as follows:\n\nFirst is $${Dependent}_{i,t}=\\beta_{0}$ $+\\beta_{1}BETA_{i,t}+\\beta_{2}ERP_{i,t}+\\beta_{3}PRS_{i,t}+\\beta_{4}Market~{}Cap_{i,t}$ (8)\n$+\\beta_{5}Debt~{}to~{}Capital_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}Liquidity_{i,t}+\\beta_{7}SD_{i,t}+\\beta_{8}MTB_{i,t}+$\n$\\beta_{9}Institution_{i,t}+\\beta_{10}ESG_{i,t}+\\beta_{11}Dependent_{i,t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i,t}$\n\nAnd second is $${Dependent}_{i,t}=\\beta_{0}$ $+\\beta_{1}BETA_{i,t}+\\beta_{2}ERP_{i,t}+\\beta_{3}PRS_{i,t}+\\beta_{4}Market~{}Cap_{i,t}$ (9)\n$+\\beta_{5}Debt~{}to~{}Capital_{i,t}+\\beta_{6}Liquidity_{i,t}+\\beta_{7}SD_{i,t}+\\beta_{8}MTB_{i,t}$\n$+\\beta_{9}Institution_{i,t}+\\beta_{10}Community_{i,t}+\\beta_{11}Controversies_{i,t}$\n$+\\beta_{12}CSRStrategy_{i,t}$\n$+\\beta_{13}Emissions_{i,t}+\\beta_{14}EnvInnovation_{i,t}+\\beta_{15}Human~{}Rights_{i,t}$\n$+\\beta_{16}Management_{i,t}+\\beta_{17}ProductResp_{i,t}+\\beta_{18}ResourceUse_{i,t}$\n$+\\beta_{19}Shareholders_{i,t}+\\beta_{20}Workforce_{i,t}+\\beta_{21}Dependent_{i,t-1}$\n$+\\varepsilon_{i,t}$\n\nThe instruments used are the lagged, differenced, and independent variables.\n\nAs can be seen, I follow the existing literature, using beta, market cap, debt to capital, and MTB as financial control variables on the cost of equity *(Hail and Leuz, 2006; Gebhardt et al., 2001; Dhaliwal et al., 2006; El Ghoul et al., 2011)*. Based on previous results, the beta, debt to capital, and MTB variables are expected to have positive coefficients as they add to firm risk. Market cap on the other hand is expected to have a negative coefficient. To this, I add liquidity as *Saad and Samet (2017)* find that liquidity risks affect the cost of capital, with more liquid stocks having a lower cost of capital. Intuitional ownership is included as *Collins and Huang (2011)* find that management entrenchment is associated with increases in the costs of equity capital, so I would expect the coefficient to be negative. The SD variable is included as a measure of unsystematic risk, so its coefficient is expected to be positive, and if markets are efficient, insignificant.\n\nThe signs on the ESG variables are not specified, as they are inconsistent in the prior literature, found to be both positive and negative, raising and lowering the cost of equity in emerging markets, which is part of what this research is about.\n\n## 4 Results\n\nTables 7 and 8 present the estimation results for all firms from 2002 to 2022.\n\nThe estimation results of Table 7 show that the Greenwash variable is negative and insignificant for the costs of capital and its components and it is negative and significant for roe. This contradicts the findings of *Li et al. (2023)*, who found a positive relationship between greenwashing and roa. The difference may be that *Li et al. (2023)* study only researched Chinese firms or that firms that are more strongly greenwashing use more debt in financing their assets, which could decrease book assets in the roa variable, but might increase the free cash flow to the firm and Tobin's Q through the effects of the deb tax shield.\n\nThe Greenwash variable is positive and significant for the fcff variable. This indicates that higher levels of greenwashing lead to higher levels of cash flow within the firm. The juxtaposition between the results on roe and fcff seems strange.

Greenwash25% is a dummy variable, which takes on a value of 1 if the Greenwash score is less than or equal to -0.6019885, and 0 otherwise. Beta is estimated by regressing weekly returns on stock against the local index using 5 years of data. Capitalized R&amp;D is R&amp;D expenses amortized over five years at the cost of capital. Cash is Cash and Marketable Securities reported in the balance sheet. Debt to capital is the market value of debt divided by the market value of debt plus the market value of equity.

Standard errors are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** signify significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The Sargan Test Stat. tests the null hypothesis of no endogeneity.\nThe Greenwash variable exhibits a positive and significant coefficient on Tobin's Q variable. This implies that high greenwashing firms are associated with a higher long-term value. This is in contrast with previously reported work by Ghitti et al. (2020). They found a negative relationship between their greenwashing variable and their estimate of Tobin's Q. One possible explanation is the difference in the estimate of Tobin's Q. Ghitti et al. use only the market value of debt and equity divided by the book value of debt and equity. I use the methodology of Peters and Taylor (2017), which adjusts for the value of firm intangible assets.\n\nThe ESG score is negative and significant for the cost of debt and the cost of equity. The cost of debt result is similar to the results of Raimo et al. (2021), Eliwa et al. (2021), and Apergis et al. (2022). The cost of equity result expands upon the results of Ng and Rezaee (2015) who also find that ESG scores have a negative relationship with the cost of equity estimates.\n\nInterestingly, for firms using a high greenwashing strategy, there is a negative relationship between institutional ownership and Tobin's Q. Buchanan et al. (2018) find a strong positive relationship between institutional ownership and Tobin's Q, for example. Their hypothesis is that firms with higher institutional ownership monitor firms and prevent them from over-investing in ESG-related activities and thus make them less prone to certain risks. The results here complicate such an interpretation. While greenwashing firms might be \u201cunderinvesting\u201d in ESG activities, it is difficult to understand why monitoring by institutional investors would then result in a drag on Tobin's Q.\n\nThe Greenwash variable is positive and significant for the coe2 variable. This signifies that brownwashing leads to a higher cost of equity capital. The Greenwash variable is negative and significant for the fcff variable, in contrast to the findings for the Greenwash75% data. This is similar to brownwashing having a negative effect on fcff. Brownwashing firms have Refinitiv Emissions and ResourceUse scores higher than CSRStrategy scores in their makeup. Gregory (2022) finds a generally negative relation between Emissions and ResourceUse and fcff. This also supports the results of Kim and Lyon (2015) and Testa et al. (2018a).\n\nGregory (2022) also finds a positive and significant relationship between Refinitiv ESG scores and fcff, as is found here in Table 8. Table 8 exhibits a positive and significant coefficient on ESG for Tobin's Q in contrast to the findings of Shi et al. (2015) but similar to the findings of Surroca et al. (2010), Sharma and Thukral (2016), Kim et al. (2019), and Kurt and Peng (2021). Further, the ESG score is negative and significantly related to the cost of debt, as with the previous results.\n\nAs a further robustness test, I regress the dependent variables on the Greenwash score and the squared Greenwash score. I use the squared score to help capture any non-linearities in the relationship as the results of Table 9 indicate there may be sign changes in regards to the Greenwash score with some of the dependent variables. The results are exhibited in Table 9.\n\nThe Greenwash score is only significant and negative for the roe dependent variable. This is in agreement with the previous results for the Greenwash75% variable. The overall effect of a rise in the Greenwash variable would be to increase the roe.\n\nESG is found to be negative and significant for cod and coe1, similar to the results in Table 8. ESG is found to have a positive and significant coefficient for Tobin's Q, similar to the results in Table 9. Also, here, I regress the standard deviation of the firm's stock returns on the independent variables as a measure of undiversified risk. The coefficient is positive and significant at the 5% level. This signifies that greenwashing increases undiversified risk.\n\nThe results above indicate that ESG scores have a positive effect on greenwashing. An examination of the relationship between the subcomponents of the ESG score and the ESG score from Refinitiv is examined below in Table 10 from an OLS Regression. Refinitiv does not publish the exact methodology used in combining the subcomponents into the ESG score (Refinitiv 2022).\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\nTable 9.

Cod is the after-tax cost of debt = pre-tax cost of debt (1 - tax rate). The average effective tax rate for the sector is used for this computation. Coe1 is estimated using the capital asset pricing model: cost of equity = risk-free rate + beta (risk premium). The average beta for the sector is used. I use the long-term treasury bond rate as the risk-free rate and a  $5.5\\%$  risk premium. Coe2 is the dividend yield of the stock plus the reinvestment rate times the roe. Wacc is the market-weighted cod and coe1. Roe is the net income divided by the book value of equity. Fcff = EBIT(1-t) - (capital expenditures - depreciation) - change in non-cash working capital. Tobin's Q is estimated using the methodology of Peters and Taylor (2017). ESG is the Refinitiv ESG score. Greenwash is the Greenwash score detailed in the text above. Greenwash\u00b2 is the squared Greenwash score. Beta is estimated by regressing weekly returns on stock against the local index using 5 years of data. Capitalized R&amp;D is R&amp;D expenses amortized over five years at the cost of capital. Cash is Cash and Marketable Securities reported in the balance sheet. Debt to capital is the market value of debt divided by the market value of debt plus the market value of equity. Institutions is the shares held by institutions/shares outstanding. Liquidity is the average number of shares traded divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market cap is the estimated market value of shares outstanding, obtained by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the share price. Net cap exp is capital expenditures - depreciation. Prs is the political risk variable for the home country from ICRG. Sd is the standard deviation of daily stock returns over the year. Industry, year, and country effects are controlled for but not reported to save space. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** signify significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The Sargan Test Stat. tests the null hypothesis of no endogeneity.\n\nAs Table 10 shows, CSRStrategy, defined as the score which measures a company's practices to communicate that it integrates the economic (financial), social, and environmental dimensions into its day-to-day decision-making processes, has the largest effect in determining a firm's ESG score. In that greenwashing is in part defined as communicating selectively too much about social and economic dimensions not substantiated by performance, this brings up the possibility of a feedback loop between greenwashing and ESG scoring via the practices of ESG rating firms.\n\nIf, as demonstrated in Table 10, ESG rating firms give higher weights in determining their ESG scores to firms that communicate about environmental and social dimensions without reckoning for greenwashing, this leads to a feedback loop. Greenwashing firms will be encouraged to increase their greenwashing to obtain better ESG ratings.\n\nTo test this further, I conduct Granger causality tests between the Greenwash variable, the ESG score, and the CSRStrategy score. The results are shown in Table 11.\n\nThere is evidence that greenwashing Granger-causes CSRStrategy of the firm and that CSRStrategy causes ESG, as also affirmed in the results of Table 11 and from Refinitiv (2022). In return, ESG Granger-causes greenwashing at the  $3.5\\%$  level. So, the evidence supports that there is a weak feedback loop between greenwashing and ESG rating scores. This implies that greenwashing behavior is not penalized much in the Refinitiv ESG scores.\n\nLastly, I re-estimate the main model, dividing the sample by developed markets and emerging markets as suggested by an anonymous referee. The results are presented in Tables 12 and 13.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2024, 17, 526\n\nTable 10.

Greenwashing, in general, has no effect on systematic risks. ESG positively affects greater free cash flow to the firm. In emerging markets, both ESG and greenwashing are associated with a lower after-tax cost of debt, but only greenwashing is associated with a lower weighted cost of capital. Thus, it may be the case that in emerging markets, greenwashing firms are better able to take advantage of lower-cost debt and use a greater amount of debt in their capital structure to lower their overall cost of debt. This is somewhat held up by the group means of the debt-to-capital variable, for which the mean is 0.251 for developed market firms and 0.279 for emerging market firms.

By analyzing both general visibility (sensitive industry membership) and issue visibility (sustainability controversies), we aim to provide insights into how managers utilize linguistic style in response to visibility pressures.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 2,139 SR CEO letters, we examine functional, affective, and cognitive linguistic elements and identify three prominent style profiles: formal-analytical, assertive, and defensive. Multivariate regression is employed to test how general and issue visibility affect these profiles.\n\nFindings: CEOs in less visible industries tend to show a higher propensity for assertive language to project leadership and control. In contrast, companies with higher general visibility tend to use more analytical language, suggesting that formally and logically aligning with public information seems to be a pragmatic way for CEOs in sensitive industries to establish credibility and legitimacy. However, when these CEOs face sustainability controversies, they step in head-on to contextualize the issues in a reactive manner to contain legitimacy threats.\n\nOriginality: Our research offers a fine-grained linguistic focus on IM in SR CEO letters, highlighting prominent linguistic style patterns and underlying drivers. We show that the identified language styles are not mutually exclusive but are triggered by distinct legitimacy concerns. We explicitly consider interdependency between the CEO letter and the main report and assess readability as a derivative of primary stylistic choice. The sample allows us to make inferences on how capital market differences affect CEO language postures.\n\nKeywords: sustainability reporting; impression management; legitimacy theory; visibility dynamics; corporate communication; sustainability communication\n\n1\n# 1. Introduction\n\nSustainability reporting (SR)\u00b9 is used as a communication tool providing information on companies\u2019 sustainability-related activities to address the societal call for sustainable business and to build, enhance or repair organizational legitimacy. As the demand for transparency and accountability regarding corporate sustainability has been increasing among stakeholders, SR has become a standard corporate practice. Many studies, however, have demonstrated false claims, unmet promises or omitted performance outcomes in SR, which cause concerns that organizations \u201ctalk but do not walk the sustainability\u201d. Consequently, the credibility and the quality of sustainability-related disclosures are often debated in the interdisciplinary accounting literature, suggesting that SR is prone to impression management (IM) strategies. While the literature offers extensive empirical evidence of IM in SR, its antecedents are not fully understood. In our study, we contribute to filling this research gap by focusing on linguistic style features of CEO narratives in SR as indicators of rhetorical IM.\n\nNarrative sections in SR contain personalized messages and business tales, addressing key corporate events, achievements and future prospects as presented by the corporate leader (Fuoli, 2018). We explore corporate visibility as a driver and/or constraint of IM practices in CEO letters, in line with Leary and Kowalski (1990). Our investigation distinguishes between general (related to industry membership) and issue visibility (driven by sustainability controversies reflecting unethical and irresponsible business behavior), both of which hold particular relevance in sustainability research (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). While several authors argue that increased visibility and related scrutiny, make companies less prone to IM (e.g., Marquis et al., 2016), others suggest that companies with higher environmental exposure and institutional pressure - and consequently, greater public visibility - are more inclined to engage in IM practices to legitimize their environmentally unfriendly operations (e.g., Stacchezzini et al., 2016). We address these contradictions in the literature in three ways.\n\nFirst, drawing upon legitimacy theory, we argue that general and issue visibility relate to different legitimacy-related motives, i.e., maintaining legitimacy versus repairing legitimacy, which promote distinct IM strategies to match legitimacy-related requirements. The level of scrutiny for overt IM is clearly higher for companies operating in sustainability-sensitive industries\u00b2 (hereafter referred to as sensitive industries), where the institutional environment is characterized by stringent regulations and governance structures due to their higher business exposure (Aerts and Cormier, 2009). For companies operating in sensitive industries, using formal and analytical language strategically in concert with institutionalized reporting formats and avoiding explicit self-serving IM are expected to foster perceived accountability and transparency and, thus, maintain legitimacy. Issue visibility driven by sustainability controversies, on the other hand, creates a gap between the desired and current image of companies through media and news and disrupts the legitimacy status-quo (Kuruppu et al., 2019). In such cases, managers are forced to respond to this disruption to repair damaged legitimacy by applying reactive IM strategies (Arvidsson, 2010). As the relationship between general visibility and the use of IM strategies is context-dependent and is likely to be affected\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 In the literature, different terms have been used for SR, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting; social/environmental reporting; environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting; corporate social disclosures, etc. In this paper, we systematically use \u201csustainability reporting\u201d, following the inclusive definition of sustainability in the Brundtland Report (1987).\n\n\u00b2 Following prior literature (Garcia et al., 2017; Passetti et al., 2018), we define sustainability-sensitive industries as those having a major socio-environmental impact and being subject to social taboos, moral debates and political pressures. These industries include materials (chemicals, metals &amp; mining, forestry-paper &amp; wood products), electric utilities, and oil and gas producers.\nby the company's business exposure, we also assess the effect of the interaction of industry and controversies on the use of IM.\n\nSecond, prior SR studies have predominantly focused on content-based IM, including selective disclosure (e.g., Marquis et al., 2016, Roszkowska-Menkes et al., 2024) and imagery (e.g., Boiral, 2013), while little attention has been paid to style-related IM, i.e., managers' use of language. The discretionary nature of corporate narratives can be exploited opportunistically by managers by crafting linguistic style to guide readers on how content is to be appreciated along a preferred mindset (Talbot and Boiral, 2018). Style-based IM can take a variety of forms using affective tone, personalization or cognitive devices (e.g., causal language, certainty expressions, etc.). While the limited prior research in this area has primarily examined readability manipulation as an obfuscation strategy (e.g., Li et al., 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018), our study offers a more nuanced analysis of linguistic style in SR.\n\nFinally, we focus on the CEO letter as a distinct genre within SR, offering the highest degree of freedom in editorial and linguistic choice and not directly burdened by institutionalized reporting frameworks. Research on the actual talk of sustainability in the CEO letter is currently rather limited (Arvidsson, 2023). We need to acknowledge, however, that the CEO letter is not a comprehensive nor an independent SR vehicle. It is rather a somewhat superimposed piece in the SR repertoire that provides the CEO the opportunity to put a personal stamp on how to position the corporate sustainability challenge, but with the main report as the bottom line. Editorial choice may materialize in summarizing highlights of the main report, introducing the general setting or providing closure of the issues involved. Whatever the chosen editorial perspective, it can be assumed that the level of transparency of the main report will affect the language use in the CEO report. By disregarding the specific status and interdependency of the CEO letter, previous studies might have overlooked the nuanced ways in which CEOs' editorializing complements the main report responding to stakeholders' legitimacy concerns. By controlling for the overall transparency level of SR, we investigate how CEOs engage with the information presented therein.\n\nTo this end, we employ a sample of 2,139 CEO letters from 384 companies from the EU, the UK and the US that published a stand-alone SR between 2010 and 2019. We utilize the three summary variables and the cognitive processes variable of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, which reveal the functional, affective and cognitive linguistic elements encompassed within SR CEO letters. Through factor analysis, we identify rhetorical profiles in SR CEO letters. This approach yields three rhetorical profiles: (1) formal-analytical; (2) assertive; and (3) defensive. Formal-analytical relates to formal, rational and hierarchical language use (Pennebaker et al., 2015), while assertive and defensive relate to narrative styles that are less technical and less factual but imply purposeful sense-giving (Arvidsson and Johansson, 2019, Caliskan et al., 2021). Using the three profiles, we test our hypotheses using multivariate regression analyses. In doing so, our analysis goes beyond the limited body of research on rhetorical IM in SR, which predominantly relies on qualitative methodologies with a small sample size.\n\nOur findings document that CEOs in more visible industries show a lower propensity to use assertive rhetorical IM refraining from outward-facing and authoritative communication. These companies tend to use more formal-analytical language in CEO letters. It reflects a risk-averse and personally detached CEO stance, aimed at maintaining legitimacy under greater scrutiny and governance pressure by fostering an aura of accountability and objectivity. This would imply that general visibility is not a motivator for explicit IM but rather acts as a constraint. However, when companies in sensitive industries are faced with company-specific sustainability challenges, CEOs step in to actively explain or contextualize the issues in a reactive manner to repair/restore threatened legitimacy. Our results suggest that the CEO's\n\n3\nreactive cognitive framing in response to controversies is mainly prompted by general visibility. Interestingly, we find that identified explicit IM styles are both positively correlated with readability, shedding new light on the use of low readability as a proxy for IM in prior studies. With respect to the interdependency between the CEO letter and the main part of the report, our results indicate that, in general, higher disclosure transparency tends to promote more formal-analytical language and less rhetorical IM by the CEO. This suggests that CEO letters are, indeed, not independent documents separate from the main report and that CEOs appear to consider the company's general disclosure transparency when constructing their narrative. Overall, our results offer valuable insights into the interconnections among visibility, scrutiny and concerns about legitimacy, enriching the scholarly discourse within the field of corporate sustainability.\n\nThe remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: The second part provides a brief literature review of SR and IM. In the third part, we introduce visibility notions and develop our hypotheses. The methodology used is presented in part four. The fifth part presents our research findings (including robustness checks). Finally, in part six, we discuss our findings and conclude.\n\n## 2. Literature review\n\n### 2.1. SR and related CEO letters from the legitimacy lens\n\nPrior research shows that SR is considered a hybrid disclosure outlet, combining both promotional and informative functions (Fuoli, 2018). Promotional aspects are particularly evident in narrative sections that stress storytelling which is crucial in shaping stakeholder perception (Aerts and Cormier, 2009; Marais, 2012). The SR CEO letter is prominent in this regard. It is generally acknowledged that the CEO letter is one of the most read parts of the annual report (e.g., Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Amernic et al., 2010; Liu and Liu, 2023). While CEOs may not be the primary authors of these letters (Liu and Nguyen, 2020), which are presumably the \u201cend product that has been filtered through several layers in the company\u201d (Arvidsson, 2023, p. 34), CEOs exert significant influence on both their content and linguistic style (Post et al., 2022). Bearing their signature, CEOs have a personal interest in at least closely reviewing and approving the final version of the CEO letter before making it public (Amernic et al., 2010)\u00b3. A CEO letter is, however, not written in isolation. It is not a standalone reporting device but rather an integral part of the SR repertoire. As such, it needs to be understood as a highly discretionary component part of the larger SR package. This may mean significant interdependency with the scope and content of the main sustainability reports and a high degree of diversity in editorial choices made across companies.\n\nOverall, legitimacy theory views SR as a means to uphold legitimacy and address external pressures (Cho and Patten, 2007). Organizational legitimacy can be sustained or altered either through corporate actions or by managing perceptions, with the latter probably being the easier and cheaper alternative (Bansal and Kistruck, 2006). In this regard, SR CEO letters can be used as a symbolic legitimacy tool to proactively bolster or amend the company image and reputation or to repair damaged legitimacy (Cho and Patten, 2007). From this perspective, SR CEO letters do not always reflect a company's authentic dedication to sustainability (Talbot and Boiral, 2018), nor are they solely motivated by transparency and\n\n\u00b3 Prior research convincingly demonstrates that CEO characteristics (e.g., gender, overconfidence, narcissism) influence the language (e.g., tone, readability) used in CEO letters (Liu and Nguyen, 2020; Le Maux and Smaili, 2024). In a similar vein, studies show that CEO changes lead to variations in style, length, and content of the letters, while letters signed by the same CEO tend to exhibit consistency (Eggers and Kaplan, 2009). Indeed, famous business leaders, such as Jack Welch and Warren Buffet, publicly acknowledged their strong involvement in shaping their CEO letters (Amernic et al., 2010).\naccountability concerns, but also need to be understood as a response to external scrutiny pressures (Cho et al., 2010). Moreover, Marais (2012) points out the predominance of the theme of moral legitimacy when communicating sustainability efforts, with an emphasis on portraying the organization as a good corporate citizen by employing discourse of goodwill and through invoking emotion and affection to persuade the audience. Such a communication approach would necessarily rely on language and rhetoric to convince the audience of a preferred mindset.\n\n## 2.2. Impression Management\n\nPerception management within the context of legitimacy strategies is close to the concept of IM which refers to the processes by which people manage and control the image they display with the intention of changing the impression of others in order to be perceived and evaluated more favorably (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Leary and Kowalski (1990) portray an array of IM drivers that either relate to IM motivation or IM construction\u2074. We argue that the visibility dimensions that we investigate in this study, are circumstantially related to both components of their model.\n\nIn SR narratives, IM can be achieved through thematic control (e.g., biased selection of themes, performance comparisons or visual presentation) and through style control (e.g., the use of complicated language to obfuscate bad news) (Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). What we refer to as rhetorical IM are editorial and linguistic choices that are instrumental in building support, convincing investors, and sustaining confidence and credibility; they are primarily style-related.\n\nTraditionally, IM in narrative disclosures has been mainly studied by examining the relationship between linguistic features and organizational performance (Melloni et al., 2016). When company activities and outcomes are desirable, managers tend to adopt IM as an assertive strategy in a proactive manner to enhance and emphasize companies' positive outcomes to gain competitive advantage (Barkemeyer et al., 2014; Boiral et al., 2020). Assertive IM involves highlighting unique organizational competencies and business skills (Boiral et al., 2020; Bolino et al., 2008). Managers using this strategy stress the importance, relevance and scope of positive environmental outcomes or actions positing an acclaiming and self-confident stance in the message delivered (Aerts and Cormier, 2009; Aerts and Yan, 2017). In other words, the aim of assertive IM is to make a positive outcome more obvious to the audience and project an impression of organizational success. These strategies are reflected in managers' use of language, where a stronger positive tone, extensive self-referencing, emphatic certainty expressions and achievement- and future-related content references are used (Aerts and Yan, 2017). In the context of SR, scarce evidence suggests that in companies with good sustainability performance, managers tend to use a tone of optimism, clarity and certainty, as well as readable language to signal their achievements (Li et al., 2023).\n\nIn circumstances that threaten legitimacy, managers tend to employ defensive IM strategies (Bolino et al., 2008). In the literature, defensive IM strategies, which encompass distractions, apologies, excuses, justifications or self-handicapping, are used as an umbrella term for reactive mechanisms (Boiral et al., 2020). By using such techniques, managers can deny responsibility for negative outcomes, or seek to re-establish a positive identity by removing negative perceptions and purposefully giving sense to the organization's actions (Caliskan et al., 2021). They may also prefer to withhold or obfuscate unfavorable\n\n\u2074 IM motivation reflects the desire to influence others' perceptions, while IM construction focuses on determining the impressions one aims to create and the strategies to achieve them. IM motivation is associated with goal-relevance of impressions, value of desired goals and discrepancy between desired and current image. The second component, IM construction, relates to self-concept, desired and undesired identity images, role constraints, target\u2019s values and current or potential social image (Leary and Kowalski, 1990).\nperformance-related information (Fabrizio and Kim, 2019). Defensive strategies have also been associated with less readable disclosures (Li et al., 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018) to obfuscate poor results or with the remedial use of causal language in order to rationalize negatively perceived outcomes and minimize management responsibility for them (Zhang and Aerts, 2015).\n\nMost IM mechanisms studied in prior SR research (such as thematic choice, arguments offered and attributional analysis) rely on a combination of thematic or propositional content and style features. The rhetorical IM features that we investigate are, however, largely detached from the substance or propositional content of the CEO letter, but are deemed to be important to ground the persuasiveness and credibility of the message. For example, assertive language usually relies on a positive tone, extensive self-referencing, clarity and certainty expressions. For defensive IM, managers tend to use more cautious framing and sense-giving devices, such as engagement markers (e.g., \"consider\", \"note that\", \"you can see that\") that \"project an aura of credibility gained by openness\" and hedging expressions (e.g., \"might\", \"perhaps\", \"possible\") which help create distance from the message and avoid direct responsibility (Aerts and Yan, 2017, p. 416; Hyland, 1998). Those linguistic style markers are helpful in organizing and evaluating propositional content in such a way that readers are guided and directed to how they should distill meaning from, appraise and respond to the information presented (Crismore et al., 1993). They add a sense-giving layer to propositional content and tend to reveal the messenger's stance with regard to the issues involved. Their effectiveness will ultimately depend on the credibility of the signals involved. Credible signals will have to resonate with the background expectations of the audience. In that regard, rhetorical signals must be perceived as credible, not only within the context of the CEO letter as such, but also within the larger disclosure environment of which the CEO letter is only a part. Public industry knowledge and evidence of company-specific performance and behavior as embedded in the larger information environment may act as a constraint on the construction of credible IM.\n\n## 3. Hypotheses development\n\nThe main research question of this study is how corporate visibility affects rhetorical IM in SR CEO letters. Corporate visibility has multiple dimensions including general visibility, reflecting the degree to which a company is salient or prominent in the public eye due to its size or industry membership (Ruiz-Blanco et al., 2021), and issue visibility, reflecting the salience of company-specific issues or controversies (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). Visibility tends to escalate institutional pressure and public scrutiny over corporate behavior. As such, it is believed to affect companies' tendency to symbolism and IM (Greenwood et al., 2011). General visibility is associated with stringent scrutiny over corporate activities and disclosures, yet it does not create a legitimacy threat as such. Disruption in the \"legitimacy status-quo\" can be a result of a major sustainability controversy that increases the issue visibility of a company.\n\n## 3.1. General visibility and IM\n\nWhile heightened general visibility associated with sensitive industry membership might increase awareness of the importance of SR and stakeholder engagement, it does not necessarily translate into a direct motivation for IM. Instead, it fosters a complex interplay between institutional pressures, perceived risks and strategic communication choices.\n\nCompanies in sensitive industries, such as oil and gas extraction or chemical manufacturing, often have greater business exposure, defined as the degree to which an organization affects its environment and is affected by it (Michelon et al., 2013). This heightened exposure translates into increased scrutiny from a broad range of stakeholders and\ncreates a strong incentive to maintain legitimacy and the social license to operate through transparent and consensual reporting (Arvidsson, 2014). Institutional literature argues that in a scrutinized environment, accountability and reporting practices tend to become ritualized, largely due to coercive isomorphism stemming from shared agreements and industry regulations (Larrinaga-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007). To maintain legitimacy, managers operating in sensitive industries tend to imitate the decisions and reporting practices of industry leaders within the same institutional reference groups (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Van Caneghem and Aerts, 2011). This mimetic isomorphism can lead to increased standardization and use of generally accepted reporting formats, potentially limiting opportunities for more nuanced or individually tailored IM strategies (Aerts and Tarca, 2010).\n\nThese arguments suggest that general visibility is not a motivator for IM, but rather acts as a constraint of IM, whereby the current public image of companies in sensitive industries (as embedded in public industry knowledge and documented in transparent SR formats) curbs the construction of IM alternatives (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Given the low probability of success in creating an alternative impression when the current public image is salient, people are reluctant to present themselves in ways that are inconsistent with information others have about them (Leary and Kowalski, 1990, p. 42). This would, a fortiori, apply to the CEO letter for which the main sustainability report presets a large part of public company-specific information to which the CEO must relate in the CEO letter. Further, the presence of an evaluative audience, aware of the potential for IM, can create a cautious disclosure attitude in corporate narratives. Recognizing that IM strategies can backfire and be perceived as misleading or \"cheap talk\" in a highly scrutinized environment (Rogers et al., 2011), managers in sensitive industries might avoid overtly promotional language and prioritize presenting objective, verifiable data to support their claims. This aligns with Aerts et al.'s (2013) finding that in highly scrutinized contexts, managers tend to favor technical accounting explanations based on formal and analytical language over more discretionary causal expressions. Thus, while not precluding all forms of IM, the heightened scrutiny in sensitive industries likely shifts the focus toward substantiating claims with verifiable data and aligning with industry best practices, potentially leading to a more cautious and less overtly promotional communication style. This strategic response basically aims at protecting the company's reputation and maintaining legitimacy by minimizing the risk of criticism.\n\nIn contrast, companies in non-sensitive industries may operate with less public visibility and face less stringent regulatory pressures, creating a more discretionary reporting environment. Crilly et al. (2012, p. 1436) argue that companies in non-sensitive industries hold \"high potential for information asymmetry and can easily build smokescreens around their internal practices\". This reduced scrutiny may create opportunities for the CEO for purposive editorializing language and tone, using interactional cues of rational, affective and interpersonal appeal that go beyond matter-of-fact reporting and guide the audience to a preferred mindset. Based on the above discussion, we predict the following:\n\nH1a: General visibility driven by sensitive industry membership is positively associated with the use of more formal and analytical language in the CEO letter.\n\nH1b: General visibility driven by sensitive industry membership is negatively associated with the use of more explicit rhetorical IM in the CEO letter.\n\n## 3.2. Issue visibility and IM\nIssue visibility is prompted by the salience of company-specific sustainability-related issues or controversies. Corporate controversies, defined as publicly observable events that are expected to have negative implications on the firm (Del Giudice and Rigamonti, 2020, p.2), attract media attention and create a gap between a company's desired image and its current, less favorable public perception, ultimately jeopardizing the company's legitimacy and value (DasGupta, 2021; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992).\n\nDrawing on Leary and Kowalski's (1990) two-component model of IM, we argue that sustainability controversies affect both impression motivation and impression construction. Controversies not only increase public perception, making impressions more goal-relevant, but also highlight the discrepancy between a company's desired and current image, both increasing managers' motivation to employ IM strategies. The choice of IM strategy is influenced by the current and potential social image that the company aims to project. Sustainability controversies, as public failures, damage a firm's current image and compel managers to adopt face-saving strategies and legitimization tactics such as apologies, excuses, and self-serving attributions to dissociate themselves from negative events (Boiral, 2016; Hahn and L\u00fclf s, 2014).\n\nMost narrative IM tactics blend propositional content with an appropriate language style. A defensive style tends to include cognitive mechanisms, such as tentative expression, hedges, directive language and insight words, that signal cognitive effort and facilitate coherence and comprehension of the message by the receiver (Hyland, 1998). They tend to invoke plausibility rather than certainty. Such cognitive mechanisms are helpful in signaling the presence of a considerate, capable and honest communicator. As such, they are likely to sustain the CEO's credibility and honesty, making it easier for stakeholders to connect with the challenges and constraints of the company (Aerts and Yan, 2017). Relatedly, sustainability controversies are likely to undermine the credibility of an overly optimistic tone and of self-serving acclaiming and storytelling. Further, as reported by Rogers et al. (2011), overly optimistic language (as in assertiveness) can increase litigation risks during corporate controversies.\n\nConversely, in the absence of controversy, CEOs have more room to proactively claim positive achievements and to portray a positive image of an authoritative, confident and engaging actor in the sustainability domain. As Tata and Prasad (2015) suggest, CEOs in companies with a neutral or favorable public image are likely to use assertive communication to further enhance their reputation, while companies facing negative publicity are more likely to adopt a more protective stance. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n\nH2a: Issue visibility driven by sustainability controversies is positively associated with defensive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter.\n\nH2b: Issue visibility driven by sustainability controversies is negatively associated with assertive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter.\n\nSustainability controversies pose a legitimacy risk for all companies; however, firms operating in sensitive industries are particularly vulnerable due to heightened public and regulatory scrutiny associated with the inherent risks of their operations. Greater business exposure would exacerbate reputational and financial vulnerabilities when controversies put legitimacy in jeopardy (Aouadi and Marsat, 2018; Del Giudice and Rigamonti, 2020). In sensitive industries, where accidents are especially costly to the environment and society, regulators tend to be less forgiving than in non-sensitive industries (DesJardine et al., 2023).\n\n8\nThe higher damage potential of controversies in sensitive industries may heighten the perceived severity of image discrepancies and increase the goal relevance of perception management (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). We expect this to act as a strong motivator for CEOs in sensitive industries to take up an active rhetorical stance to engage with the audience in an effort to restore perceived legitimacy in a reactive mode. Only relating to or reinforcing corporate disclosures from the main report through complacent formal language in a descriptive or analytic fashion would not suffice in that regard. To restore confidence, effective rhetorical language is expected to invoke a sense of immediacy in order to rationalize or normalize mediatized controversies. This is consistent with prior research demonstrating the use of legitimization strategies for negative incidents among sensitive industries (Hahn and L\u00fclf, 2014; Talbot and Boiral, 2018).\n\nMoreover, given the challenges managers in sensitive industries face when trying to highlight favorable outcomes from their sustainability initiatives, we project that general visibility will amplify the CEOs' resistance to using an assertive communication style when addressing controversies. In non-sensitive industries, controversies may be seen as exceptions rather than part of a pattern, allowing companies more leeway to use assertive language or make positive statements in their responses. In contrast, companies in sensitive industries have high base-level exposures (Cho and Patten, 2007) and operate under higher stakeholder situational skepticism (Aqueveque et al., 2018). As such, they are closely scrutinized on how they respond to controversial issues, with particular attention to misleading claims (Marshall et al., 2023). Consequently, companies in sensitive industries are less inclined to manage their public image through the disclosure of positive information related to sustainability issues that are subject to controversy, compared to their counterparts in the less sensitive sectors (Roszkowska-Menkes et al., 2024). Thus, we expect that:\n\nH3a: The positive relationship between issue visibility and defensive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter is positively moderated by general visibility.\n\nH3b: The negative relationship between issue visibility and assertive rhetorical IM in the CEO letter is negatively moderated by general visibility.\n\n## 4. Methodology\n\nTo study rhetorical IM in SR, we employ a three-step methodological approach. First, we conduct an automated text analysis to examine the linguistic style features in SR CEO letters. Second, we conduct a factor analysis to reveal co-occurrence patterns among linguistic markers derived from the previous step to identify rhetorical IM profiles. Finally, we test our hypotheses in empirical models with the rhetorical profiles as dependent variables.\n\n## 4.1. Sample selection and data collection\n\nWe selected listed companies from the EU, the UK and the US that published a stand-alone SR for the fiscal year 2016 according to the Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters\u2019 Asset4ESG) database. The sample composition allows diversity in country-level institutional context that has been shown to affect language postures (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Liu and Liu, 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020). In this regard, we sample companies from the US, UK and Continental Europe respectively to include implicit (Continental Europe) and explicit (US and UK to a lesser degree) CSR institutional environments (Matten and Moon, 2008). Moreover, the sample composition also captures capital market differences that may affect the goal relevance and the value of desired outcomes of IM (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Structural differences in share ownership and shareholder activism as well as CEO pecuniary differentials that exist among\nAnglo-Saxon and continental European countries may affect CEO motivation to engage in IM. For example, institutional differences in CEO power and CEO compensation may affect the value of desired IM outcomes, suggesting a higher propensity in portraying CEO leadership identity and managerial competence to preserve power and lucrative compensation arrangements in an Anglo-Saxon market environment.\n\nWe extended the time frame for the selected companies from 2010 to 2019 and manually collected the reports in PDF from their websites, corporate register (corporateregister.com), and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) database (globalreporting.org). We excluded companies that operate in the healthcare, financials, real estate, government activities, and academic and educational services sectors; companies that do not publish their reports in English; companies that use integrated reporting; SR that do not include CEO letters; SR that are protected and cannot be processed; and CEO letters counting fewer than 350 words\u2075 in length. We manually processed CEO letters in SR in accordance with prior research and excluded CEO letters that do not contain sustainability-related information. This selection process yielded a sample of 2,139 CEO letters from 384 companies that we later used in factor analysis to create rhetoric variables. We combined the sample of CEO letters with data we needed for explanatory and control variables derived from Refinitiv and Bloomberg and excluded observations with missing data. The final sample used in the multivariate analyses consists of 1,805 CEO letters from 345 companies headquartered in 18 countries\u2076.\n\n## 4.2. Linguistic analysis\n\nTo examine the linguistic style used in CEO letters, we use LIWC-22, which is based on strong empirical evidence that language can provide rich insights into people's psychological states, including emotions, thinking styles, and social concerns (Boyd et al., 2022). This software has been extensively tested in numerous social psychology studies and has also been used in the corporate reporting context (e.g., Aerts and Yan, 2017; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). We use LIWC-22 to reveal the functional, affective and cognitive components of the CEO letters. We employ the three summary psychosocial variables of LIWC: (1) analytical thinking; (2) clout; and (3) emotional tone. In addition to these, we use the cognitive processes variable. The three summary variables are composite measures derived from previously published findings from Pennebaker Language Lab and converted to percentiles based on standardized scores from large comparison samples (Boyd et al., 2022). Each of the variables is transformed into a scale from 1 to 100, and they are mainly based on function words. Function words have been found to be reliable markers of psychological states, revealing how people think (Pennebaker et al., 2014). For example, high use of single-person or second/third-person pronouns has been associated with self- or other-focus, respectively; auxiliary verbs with the use of passive language; articles with formal and structured style of writing; and conjunctions with cognitive complexity (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Pennebaker et al., 2007). The analytical thinking variable captures the degree to which people use words that suggest formal, logical and hierarchical thinking patterns (Pennebaker et al., 2015). The lexical categories of a higher analytical thinking score include articles, prepositions which reflect a more technical language; while a lower score includes pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions and adverbs which reflect a more informal and personal language (Pennebaker et al., 2015). The clout variable refers to the relative social status, confidence, or leadership that people display through their language (Boyd et al., 2022). A higher clout score is measured by 1\u02e2\u1d57 person plural (we) and second-person pronouns (you), which reflects confident, credible and collectively-oriented language; while a lower clout score is measured by tentative words (e.g.,\n\n\u2075 Prior text analysis software baseline its measures based on a minimum of 350 words (https://docs.receptiviti.com/). Hence, we impose a minimum word limit for our investigation based on 350 words.\n\n\u2076 In Appendices, we present more detailed selection criteria (Table-AI) and the final sample summary statistics (Table-AII) with respect to distribution by year, country, region, and industry.\n\n10\nmaybe, perhaps) reflecting tentativeness, humble and anxious language (Kacewicz et al., 2014; Pennebaker et al., 2015). Finally, the emotional tone variable puts positive tone and negative tone dimensions into a single variable (Cohn et al., 2004). The higher the score, the more positive the tone is. Tone as a measure of text sentiment has been widely used as a proxy of disclosure balance in SR. Table I summarizes the indicators of analytical thinking, clout, and emotional tone, their directions and example words.\n\n--- [Insert Table I about here] ---\n\nCognitive processes is another composite variable that includes markers of cognitive complexity such as insight, causation, discrepancy, tentative, certitude and differentiation words. Cognitive processes words signal thought, causality and insight, and are used in situations, when people wish to transmit facts, reconstruct events and provide explanations for them (Brownlow et al., 2020, pp. 11-12). Sense-giving in accounting narratives largely depends on these linguistic devices (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007). The composite variable is expressed as a percentage of the total words used in any given language sample. Table II presents components of the cognitive processes variable with their most frequently used exemplars.\n\n--- [Insert Table II about here] ---\n\n## 4.3. Factor analysis\n\nWe use the LIWC-derived variables as inputs to factor analysis to identify salient linguistic structures in the CEO letters. We employ principal component factor analysis with varimax orthogonal rotation. The identified constructs serve further as our test variables. Table III shows the resulting variables and their respective factor loadings.\n\n--- [Insert Table III about here] ---\n\nThe analysis led to the identification of two uncorrelated factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, which cumulatively explain 72% of the overall variance. They group the stylistic and content characteristics that tend to co-occur in SR CEO letters, revealing the main explicit IM profiles in our sample. We use a cut-off of 0.20 for interpretation purposes and label the factors as follows: assertive (Factor 1) and defensive (Factor 2).\n\nBoth factors have negative loadings on analytic thinking. This provides strong support that analytic indicates a more formal and analytical style with minimal audience engagement, while identified factors represent highly narrative, less technical and less factual writing styles. Factor 1 is based on positive emotional tone and clout, highlighting social connections and accomplishments with the use of optimistic narratives, which we refer to as assertive. Factor 2 is balanced communication (e.g., neutral loading of emotional tone) with high use of cognitive processes markers that cautiously provide explanation and meaning to organizational outcomes, which we refer to as defensive. Within Factor 2, the loadings suggest that this style provides complex meanings, justifications and explanations for organizational events while avoiding strong emotional bias. To ensure accurate factor labeling and strengthen the\n\n11\nrobustness of our conclusions, we additionally account for the correlations between the factor variables and linguistic style and content variables\u2077. We present our correlation analysis in Table IV.\n\n--- [Insert Table IV about here] ---\n\nNotably, we find that readability\u2078 positively correlates with assertive and defensive styles but negatively correlates with the formal-analytical style. These results suggest that contrary to the obfuscation-through-low-readability hypothesis proposed in prior studies, more explicit rhetorical IM tends to rely on simpler, understandable language. Further, in acknowledging the diverse interpretations and classifications within the field of IM, it is important to note that the terms \u201cassertive\u201d and \u201cdefensive\u201d encompass a broad spectrum of subcategories in the literature, including enhancements, entitlements, excuses and justifications (Tedeschi and Melburg, 1984). In our investigation, as indicated by correlations observed, the assertive category is notably associated with what might be considered enhancements, portraying an overly optimistic perspective, while the defensive category aligns more with justifications or the act of sensemaking and rationalizing the communicated content.\n\n## 4.4. Empirical models\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we apply the following regression model:\n\nRhetorical style = f(INDsen, ESGcontro, INDsen X ESGcontr, controls)\n\nThe dependent variable allows for three different rhetorical styles. The first is represented by the analytical thinking variable, which loads highly negatively on the assertive and defensive factors in the factor analysis and stands for formal-analytical language use. This somewhat detached and impersonal rhetorical approach stresses logical and rational information structuring and low CEO interference to guide the audience to a preferred mindset. The other two dependent variables are derived from our factor analysis: an assertive style (Factor 1); and a defensive rhetorical approach (Factor 2). The latter two variables correspond to writing styles that are predominantly narrative and include storytelling and explicit IM elements (emotional, personal and cognitive language).\n\nThe first variable of interest (INDsen), being a dummy variable that indicates a company\u2019s membership in sensitive industries, captures general visibility (H1 and H3). In defining the variable, we follow prior literature (Garcia et al., 2017; Passetti et al., 2018) and consider materials (including chemicals, metals &amp; mining, forestry-paper &amp; wood products), oil &amp; gas and utilities as sensitive industries (dummy variable is coded one for those industries)\u2079. The second variable of interest (ESGcontro) is the ESG controversies score as a proxy for issue visibility (H2 and H3). The score is calculated by Refinitiv based on 23 ESG controversy topics and is captured from global media (third-party sourced information) that materially impact the corporations. The score allows comparison across industries and resolves the market cap bias, which large companies suffer from, as they attract more media attention than smaller companies through adjusting and normalizing scores based on company size and\n\n\u2077 Style variables are derived from LIWC-22; whereas content variables are based on the CSR dictionary developed by Pencle and Malaescu (2016), which encompasses dimensions related to employee, human rights, environment, and social and community.\n\n\u2078 FOG Readability Index is calculated as: -1 x 0.4 x (average words per sentence + percentage of complex words). In our study, higher FOG index values indicate more readable CEO letters.\n\n\u2079 We acknowledge that all companies in all industrial sectors can conduct activities with potential implications for the environment and society. Our selection of sustainability-sensitive industries includes the industries with the major socio-environmental impact, following prior literature.\n\n12\nindustry (Shakil, 2021). The controversies score is expressed as a percentage rank, where a higher score implies fewer controversies. For a more straightforward interpretation, we reverse-coded the controversies score (i.e., presence of controversies is equal to 1; and no controversies is equal to 0). To test the industry moderation effect (H3) we include the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro.\n\nOur models also include a number of control variables. To account for the interplay between sections of the report (CEO letter versus main report), we add the following two general disclosure transparency variables. First, we use a GRI dummy variable indicating whether the company follows the GRI standards/guidelines in its disclosure process. While the implementation of GRI may suggest greater transparency (Graafland and Smid, 2019), empirical evidence indicates that given the voluntary character of the framework, it is often used in a symbolic manner (Boiral, 2013; Michelon et al., 2015). Hence, we introduce Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score (DIStransparency) as a second transparency-related control variable, widely used in prior literature as a proxy for corporate transparency and accountability in sustainability (Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2022). Bloomberg's analysts track companies' disclosure on more than 800 environmental, social and governance metrics, both qualitative and quantitative. The score ranges from 0.1 for companies that disclose a minimum amount of ESG data to 100 for those that disclose every data point collected by Bloomberg. The score is comparable across sectors and regions.\n\nFurther, as prior literature indicates, companies can simultaneously be involved in sustainability controversies while demonstrating strong social and environmental performance in other areas (Price and Sun, 2017), which may lead to differing effects on corporate disclosure behavior (Dawkins and Fraas, 2010). Hence, we control for the mean of Refinitiv's environmental and social scores as the proxy for overall environmental and social performance (EnvSoc) (Ioannou and Serafeim, 2012). Additionally, to control for organizational characteristics mechanisms that may influence IM behavior we employ corporate governance variables including an assurance dummy variable (Assur) indicating whether a company's report was subject to external verification, CSR/sustainability committee (CSRcom), percentage of female directors on board (BRDwmn), board size (BRDsize), percentage of independent board directors (BRDind) and CEO duality (CEOdual). As firm-level financial controls, we use ROA as a proxy of a company's profitability, and the natural logarithm of total assets as an indicator of the company's size (Size). Consistent with established literature on the country-level institutional determinants of IM (Aerts and Yan, 2017; Liu and Liu, 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020), we also incorporate regional dummy variables (UK and US) to control for company location. Finally, we control for the time trend including year dummies in the model. Table V summarizes our variables.\n\n--- [Insert Table V about here] ---\n\nThe hypotheses are tested using random effects models that allowed us to estimate the effects of our time-invariant variable of interest (INDsen). The choice of the model was supported by the results of the Mundlak tests (Mundlak, 1978). For assertive and defensive as explained variables tests showed: Chi-squared(12) = 18.01, Prob &gt; Chi-squared = .113; Chi-squared(13) = 20.91, Prob &gt; Chi-squared = .052, respectively. These results indicate that there is no correlation between time-invariant unobservables and regressors, hence we reject the null hypotheses and conclude that the random effects models apply.\n\n13\n14\n\n# 5. Results\n\n## 5.1. Descriptive statistics\n\nTable VI provides descriptive statistics to present the overall characteristics of the companies included in the sample. 38% of our observations come from sensitive industries. The mean value for the ESG controversy score is 0.22. While the majority (76%) of the firms adhere to GRI standards, only about half of them were subject to independent assurance and the mean value of disclosure transparency (DIStransparency) among these firms is 47.01. With regard to corporate governance practices, the majority of the sample companies have CSR/sustainability committees at the board level, as well as CEO and Chairman of the Board separation. The sample companies reveal variation in terms of board size (with a mean of 11 members), independence (with 75% of independent directors on average) and board gender diversity (with 23% female board members on average). Performance statistics reveal a mean of 66.43 for EnvSoc and of 5.51 for ROA. The sample companies are quite similar though with respect to size, with a mean and standard deviation of company size of 23.44 and 1.44, respectively\u00b9\u2070.\n\n--- [Insert Table VI about here] ---\n\nTable VII presents a correlation matrix. We note that membership in sensitive industries (INDsen) is negatively correlated with two identified rhetorical IM profiles (assertive and defensive), while positively correlated with the formal-analytical style (Analytic), which provides initial support for our hypotheses (H1a and H1b). Correlation analysis also indicates that our issue visibility variable (ESGcontro) is positively correlated with defensive IM and negatively with formal-analytical style. These results provide support for our expectation regarding the prominence of defensive IM (H2a), but not for our hypothesis on the relationship between issue visibility and assertive IM (H2b). Moreover, sensitive industry membership is positively correlated with the use of GRI and overall disclosure transparency, suggesting that companies in sensitive industries value accountability and transparency to sustain legitimacy. The correlations among our independent variables do not indicate multicollinearity.\n\n--- [Insert Table VII about here] ---\n\n## 5.2. Multivariate analysis\n\nThe results based on the empirical models are reported in Table VIII. In the first three models, we tested the direct relationship (i.e., main effect) between our dependent and test variables (excluding the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro). Model (1) shows that, in line with our expectations (H1a), companies operating in sensitive industries disclose more formal and analytical SR CEO letters (i.e., significantly positive coefficient for INDsen - b = -.019, p &lt; 0.10). Model (2) documents a significantly negative relationship between INDsen and the assertive style (b = -.029, p &lt; 0.05). The results could indicate that the effect of general visibility pertains only to assertive IM and provide partial support for our hypothesis (H1b). We further\n\n\u00b9\u2070 The sample exhibits a bias towards larger firms, resulting in limited variation in terms of firm size. This observation further supports the argument that firm size should not be used as a proxy for general visibility.\nnote a significantly positive relationship between ESG controversies (ESGcontro) and defensive style in SR CEO letters (Model (3)), providing support for H2a. H2b is, however, not supported, as we observe no significant relationship between ESG controversies score and assertive IM (Model (2)).\n\n--- [Insert Table VIII about here] ---\n\nIn Models (4) up to (6), we added the interaction term between INDsen and ESGcontro to test the hypotheses regarding the moderating effect (H3a and H3b). The results indicate a significantly positive interaction effect for the defensive style (Model (6)), that supports our H3a. The lack of a statistically significant coefficient on ESGcontro in Model 6 suggests that it is companies from sensitive industries that are more prone to resort to defensive IM when controversies arise. Figure 1 depicts that the positive relationship between ESGcontro and defensiveness is observed only in sensitive industries, while it remains insignificant (indicated by a flat line) in non-sensitive industries. We find no statistically significant interaction effect in Model (5) (H3b was not supported).\n\n--- [Insert Figure 1 about here] ---\n\nRegarding our transparency-related control variables, our results show a positive effect of the DIStransparency on the use of formal-analytical style (b = .0013, p &lt; 0.01) and a negative effect on the assertive style (b = -.0012, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, our findings indicate a negative relationship between formal-analytical style and GRI (b = -.0192, p &lt; 0.5) and a positive association between assertive style and the use of these reporting standards (b = .0211, p &lt; 0.5). With respect to the corporate governance controls, assertive style seems to be constrained in the presence of larger boards (b = -.0058, p &lt; 0.01) and CSR committee (b = -.0192, p &lt; 0.1). Firms with larger representation of women on board tend to use less formal-analytical (b = -.0007, p &lt; 0.05) and more defensive language (0.0010, p&lt;0.01). Finally, both region dummies (UK and US) move in the same direction in comparison with the EU institutional setting for formal-analytical and assertive styles, that is both UK and US negatively affect the use of formal-analytical style (b = -.0707; b = -.0625, p &lt; 0.01); while positively affect the use of assertive style (b = .0522; b = .1272, p &lt; 0.01). Regarding the defensive style, however, we observe a significant effect from the UK companies (b = .0496, p &lt; 0.01), whereas no significant effect is noted from the US companies; yet both of the effects are in the same direction. According to Matten and Moon's (2008) perspective, these discrepancies could be associated with unique institutional arrangements at the regional level. Matten and Moon's (2008) implicit-explicit CSR framework suggests that both US- and UK-oriented CSR tends to be more explicit in comparison to the European-style CSR, which provides more room for corporate initiative and therefore both assertive and defensive IM. The prominence of active private investors with a short-term outlook and shareholder value oriented institutional investors in the Anglo-Saxon countries would increase awareness for and salience of public image and tend to encourage IM.\n\nAs our results show, companies operating in sensitive industries tend to use a more formal-analytical style in the SR CEO letters. Such language is rather formal, logical, and hierarchically structured in terms of how information is presented and tends to avoid the need to focus on people and actions. This suggests that the greater scrutiny and governance pressures\n\n15\nin those industries, compel management to present their sustainability efforts in a more structured, somewhat detached and low-risk manner. Similarly, there is a significant negative relationship between operating in sensitive industries and assertive storytelling style. Whereas CEOs in non-sensitive industries tend to invest in authoritative, confident and outward-facing language that reflects leadership, certainty and being in control through assertive storytelling, such tendencies are significantly lower in sensitive industries. This indicates a more cautious approach in sensitive industries, probably to avoid backlash or skepticism from stakeholders. However, the significantly positive interaction effect for the defensive style indicates that companies operating in sensitive industries are more likely to adopt a defensive stance when facing high levels of ESG controversies. So, when the company is directly faced with mediatized sustainability controversies, the CEO tends to take the stage to explain, make sense or contextualize the issues involved in a more reactive fashion, probably to protect the company's legitimacy and mitigate potential negative perceptions. Our results also suggest that as general disclosure transparency increases, CEOs are less inclined to take on an assertive posture of leadership and control. Instead, they increasingly rely on formal, low-risk information sharing (i.e., analytic). Opposite results are found for GRI-based reports, which might suggest a largely symbolic function of this voluntary disclosure framework.\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of our findings against potential bias due to the skewed distribution of ESGcontro $^{11}$ , we re-estimate our primary models for the subsample of observations with reported ESG controversies (ESGcontro&gt;0). The results (Table IX) show that the direct effect of sensitive industry membership (INDsen) and ESG controversies (ESGcontro) yield the same sign, yet the statistical significance decreases (and even disappears) for some of the previously observed effects (so in Models (1) and (3)). When the interaction term is included (Models (4) and (6)), coefficients do attain statistical significance (which is in line with the main analyses). We associate the decrease in significance levels with the smaller sample size used for the robustness check. Nevertheless, the results of the robustness check qualitatively support our primary findings.\n\n--- [Insert Table IX about here] --\n\n# 6. Discussion and conclusion\n\nCEO narratives are a powerful tool to shape public perception of a company's sustainability track record and of its alignment with societal norms and values. A SR CEO letter holds considerable leeway in highlighting key messages and themes, while the body of the report offers substantiation with more detailed information, data, and context, often in concert with institutionalized reporting formats. Prior research documents that CEO letters tend to be used for legitimacy purposes, portraying the company in a favorable light and giving the impression of acting in accordance with social expectations. Although promotional by nature, the CEO letter also needs to incorporate language that suggests transparency, accountability, and a commitment to sustainability to maintain alignment with societal expectations. This study\ninvestigates how balancing these needs is affected by corporate visibility driven by sensitive industry membership and mediatized controversies.\n\nOur paper shows that higher general visibility from sensitive industry membership with its stronger scrutiny pressures leads to a more formal and analytical language style. Avoiding explicit rhetorical IM that is typically permeated with emotional, personal and story-telling language, reflects a restrained and risk-averse communication approach that may serve as a safeguard against potential backlash from stakeholders. This caution is evident in companies operating in sensitive industries, where the risk of being seen as merely window-dressing environmental efforts is higher. While these results are consistent with findings of previous studies (e.g., Marquis et al., 2016, Ruiz-Blanco et al., 2021), we only observe an impact of general visibility on the use of assertive IM, and not on defensive IM. This indicates that both forms of rhetorical IM follow different internal logic and connect with different drivers.\n\nOur results suggest that managers allow themselves to be assertive only when they are not afraid of being accused of \"greenwashing\". Companies with a lower environmental footprint face less scrutiny and activist pressure (Marquis et al., 2016) and seem less constrained by public knowledge to profile themselves and take up an assertive stance in portraying leadership and authority in the sustainability domain as a way to establish legitimacy (Tan et al., 2014). Such outward-facing and authoritative communication allows CEOs to demonstrate confidence and control. While assertiveness is typically proactive, defensiveness is reactive and would not be consistent with an aura of confident agency and leadership. As demonstrated, defensive IM is only triggered when corporate legitimacy is overtly challenged. O'Donovan (2002) argues that the legitimation techniques chosen depend on whether the company is trying to maintain the current level of legitimacy or repair damaged legitimacy. Controversies disrupt a company's legitimacy status, rapidly attract media attention through news and social media, and increase the discrepancy between the desired and current image of the company (DasGupta, 2021; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992). This break in the legitimacy status-quo motivates CEOs to use defensive IM strategies to mitigate reputational and regulatory risks. Our findings show that in the face of a legitimacy threat, CEOs resort to sense-giving mechanisms in a more conversational style, probably in an effort to contextualize and normalize. The highly discretionary nature of the CEO letter makes it more suited to react to controversies than the main report would allow. Defensive rhetorical IM is primarily in play for companies in highly visible, sensitive industries. These companies are exceptionally vulnerable to reputational damage from mediatized sustainability controversies. Any negative event is likely to be amplified by media attention and public outrage. CEOs of these companies are under immense pressure to address the controversies head-on in their letters. They cannot simply ignore them or offer formal or vague statements but need to step in reactively to address and clarify the issues involved. As Tata and Prasad (2015) predict, the relationship between a legitimacy gap and the organization's motivation to close it through sustainability communication will be stronger under high levels of media attention and public scrutiny, which is supported by our findings.\n\nContrary to our expectations, there is no empirical evidence to substantiate a negative relationship between sustainability controversies and assertive IM. It suggests that assertive and defensive language (and formal and analytical language for that matter) are not mutually exclusive as they respond to different triggers. CEO letters may contain both assertive and defensive components with assertiveness being more pervasive and long-term than reactive language. In the same vein, CEO letters have both an analytic and a narrative component, but they are likely to differ on a continuum along which information-structural language versus story-driving language is used, depending on context (of which general visibility and issue visibility shows to be an important ingredient).\n\n17\nOur study adds to the literature in several respects. Our methodological approach offers a more fine-grained focus on linguistic features in SR CEO letters and extends the existing body of research, which predominantly depends on qualitative methods involving small sample sizes and/or does not differentiate between reporting genres within SR. First, our analysis allows us to disentangle different forms of rhetorical IM management, their mutual interactions and their underlying drivers, highlighting how they are triggered by distinct legitimacy concerns. Ultimately, the study enriches our understanding of how CEOs navigate the complex terrain of sustainability communication to manage public perception and balance highly context-dependent legitimacy needs.\n\nSecond, in contrast to prior literature that identifies low readability as an IM strategy (e.g., Li et al., 2023; Smeuninx et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018), we corroborate that both assertive and defensive IM styles tend to be more readable than a formal-analytical style. Higher readability will facilitate the accessibility of the key messages and, thus, their persuasive potential. This is consistent with the rhetorical intent of the assertive and defensive style patterns: they can only be persuasive and effective in changing impressions to the extent that they are accessible and understandable by the main audience of the CEO letter. In contrast, formal and analytical language, though probably more precise and objective, tends to be more complex and technical, which burdens readability as measured by the traditional readability formulae. Our findings suggest that readability is rather the outcome of more refined linguistic style choices than a direct IM tool.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis also reveals an interesting interdependency between the CEO letter and the main report. The empirical models show that changes in the CEO narratives with respect to language style occur in concert with the transparency of the disclosure environment. Formal-analytical language, prevalent in CEO letters of companies operating in sensitive industries, is highly impersonal and descriptive and creates a sense of objectivity and helps to establish a professional tone. It is in line with the language of accountability and transparency that permeates the main report. This suggests close alignment of the CEO letter with the main reporting outlet which, in itself, already tends to be of higher quality for sensitive industries. The relatively high information threshold of the main report may act as a constraint on promotional postures. Formally and logically aligning with what is already there in the main report seems to be the pragmatic way for CEOs in sensitive industries to maintain credibility and legitimacy. Moreover, interestingly, with respect to GRI, we observe a shift from an assertive style towards more formal and analytical language in SR that does not follow GRI guidelines. While CEOs tend to communicate in an authoritative and optimistic manner in reports prepared according to GRI, their language becomes more cautious when the report is not standard-based. This observation aligns with studies suggesting that the GRI framework may not necessarily guarantee high transparency of disclosures. Instead, it is often employed as a symbolic practice (Michelon et al., 2015; Roszkowska-Menkes et al., 2024) and, as our findings show, can be complemented by an assertive IM in the CEO letter.\n\nFinally, although not explicitly hypothesized, our findings corroborate strong region-based effects on style features of the CEO letter. CEOs from the US and UK companies typically face a more active and demanding investor environment and may have stronger power-related and pecuniary incentives to engage in active IM. In addition, the more explicit CSR environment in which these companies operate (Moon and Matten, 2008), allows more room for corporate initiative to link sustainability issues with company-level identity and reputation (Blindheim, 2015). In our data, this translates into a significant positive effect on rhetorical IM and a negative effect on formal-analytical style. This could suggest that the CEO letter in these countries is typically motivated to cater to a shareholder perspective on the company's sustainability track record.\n\n18\nWith respect to practical implications, our empirical exploration of the rhetorical IM in SR along with the identification of instances of the use of formal-analytical style and IM provides valuable insights for policymakers. This investigation enhances understanding of how CEO rhetorics is related to transparency in sustainability-related information and accountability within SR. In addition, our research is expected to help investors and analysts assess companies and the credibility of their corporate communication, which can eventually shape socially responsible investor behaviors and contribute to developing a more effective governance and regulation system in the realm of SR. This is particularly important in light of the increasing financial relevance of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Our results may also be of interest to investors and financial analysts, as assertive rhetorical IM in financial CEO letters has been shown to be negatively related to the dispersion of financial analysts' earnings forecasts and positively to earnings forecast accuracy (Yan et al., 2019).\n\nA major limitation of our study is the availability of SR of companies. The reliance on databases is insufficient, necessitating a considerable amount of time in the manual data collection process. This constraint led to a reduction in the number of disclosures included in the analysis. As a result, our sample size did not permit, for instance, a more detailed examination of the impact of the institutional environment, including nuanced distinctions between the varieties of capitalism present in Continental Europe (Pinto et al., 2019). Additionally, with the increasing use of integrated reporting (\"IR\") framework, both sustainability and financial information are combined. Yet, our sample is based on \"SR only\" to allow for a clear focus on IM strategies in sustainability-related information. Moreover, with our analysis identifying interdependencies between the CEO letter and the main body of the sustainability report, further empirical research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of how increased transparency may discipline CEO IM, particularly in light of the increasing efforts and convergence among standard-setting institutions, including the IFRS Foundation, EFRAG, and GSSB, to develop integrated and globally aligned SR standards. Lastly, the language used in CEO letters to convey personalized messages can largely be influenced by the author's characteristics, including gender and personality traits (Liu and Nguyen, 2020; Le Maux and Smaili, 2024). While this topic remains beyond the scope of our study, we encourage future research to examine how the interplay between organizational visibility and CEO characteristics affects IM in SR.\n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, future studies should explore and shed light on the factors and policies affecting accountability in SR and the influence of corporate governance factors that may restrict managers' use of SR as a symbolic legitimacy tool. We emphasize that continued efforts are needed to make SR more accountable and transparent. In final words, we would like to refer to Patten (2019): \"Legitimacy-based research can help move CSR disclosure at least closer to being a tool of accountability, as opposed to a tool for legitimation\".\n\n## Reference List\n\nAerts, W., Cheng, P., and Tarca, A.

The results indicate that ESG report greenwashing increases the stock price crash risk. In high earnings management companies, ESG report greenwashing is positively correlated with stock price crash risk, and ESG report greenwashing and earnings management are complementary. Further analysis shows that better internal and external corporate governance can suppress the impact of ESG greenwashing. In addition, in the voluntary disclosure and private enterprise samples, ESG report greenwashing has a greater impact on the stock price crash risk. Mechanism analysis found that the greenwashing of ESG reports intensified the information asymmetry, which increased the stock price crash risk. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the masking effect of socially responsible information, and that ESG greenwashing increases the stock price crash risk.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance; environmental, social and governance report; social responsibility information; greenwashing; stock price crash risk\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nClimate change risks and COVID-19 impact the sustainable development of the global economy. As the social responsibility information for evaluating the sustainable development of companies, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) report plays an increasingly important role in the capital market. For example, on 18 September 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency found that Volkswagen installed special software on the engine controller to avoid the official inspection of exhaust emissions. After the exposure of the behaviour that the emission of exhaust gas went from 10 to 40 times beyond the standard to greenwashing to high environmental protection standards, its share price fell by 40% in 1 month. After Chinese 'dual carbon' goal was put forward, the asset management scale of domestic ESG public funds increased by more than 100 billion, and the number of A-share listed companies that disclosed CSR/ESG reports in 2021 has\n\nCONTACT Yong Shi shiyong1027@126.com School of Accounting, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, 182# Nanhu Avenue, Wuhan, China\n\nPaper accepted by Xi Wu.\n\n$^{1}$https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A7%E4%BC%97%E6%B1%BD%E8%BD%A6%E5%B0%BE%E6%B0%94%E9%80%A0%E5%81%87%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6/18682048\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Previous researches have studied the relationship between social responsibility information and stock price crash risk from the perspective of information asymmetry and agency theory. From the perspective of information asymmetry and shareholder theory, social responsibility information disclosure has a communication effect and reduces the risk of stock price crash (Dai et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2014), and ESG rating can reduce stock price crash risk (Feng et al. 2022). From the perspective of agency theory, social responsibility information disclosure has a disguising effect and increases the risk of stock price crash (Barnea & Rubin, 2010; Quan & Xiao, 2016; Tian & Wang, 2017). However, existing studies only measure social responsibility information disclosure or ESG information from a single dimension, which is difficult to observe the specific motivation of management to disclose social responsibility information. What's more, corporate ESG disclosure information is different from institutional ESG rating information. There are few literatures integrating corporate ESG disclosure information and institutional ESG rating information to study the relationship between ESG information and stock price crash risk from the perspective of greenwashing.\n\nGreenwashing is an attempt by enterprises to cover up relatively poor ESG performance by disclosing false ESG information (Yu et al. 2020), mainly in order to gain legitimacy benefits (Seele & Gatti, 2017). This is different from the motivation for management to hoard bad news from the agency perspective, such as compensation contract, professional concern and empire establishment (Ball, 2009; Kothari et al. 2009). Therefore, it is of great theoretical value to research the relationship between ESG report greenwashing and stock price crash risk. On the one hand, most of the ESG reports disclosed by listed companies are non-quantitative and without audit assurance, which makes it easy for companies to manage or manipulate or greenwash the disclosure of ESG reports, thereby covering up bad information to convey a good corporate image to investors (Barnea & Rubin, 2010; Yu et al. 2020). This ESG report greenwashing behaviour may be a new mechanism for managers to hide bad news, which needs to be empirically test. On the other hand, the share price of companies fell after the exposure of greenwashing behaviour (Wang et al. 2015). Different from their research, selective disclosure, exaggeration of real performance and other greenwashing behaviours in ESG report were not directly exposed (Yu et al. 2020). The media, investors and analysts can judge the company's greenwashing behaviour by comparing the differences between the ESG disclosure quality and the ESG performance rating results to expose these negative information, and then the risk of a company's stock price crash increased (Jin & Myers, 2006).\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to empirically test the impact of ESG report greenwashing on the risk of stock price crash, and provide empirical evidence and decision-making basis for institutional investors, financial institutions and other stakeholders. This paper takes Chinese listed companies from 2014 to 2021 as a research sample, draws on the measurement method of ESG report greenwashing by Yu et al. (2020) which uses the difference between ESG report disclosure score and ESG actual performance score to measure ESG report greenwashing, and uses PSM method, Heckman and other methods to study the impact of ESG report greenwashing on stock price crash risk. We find that ESG report greenwashing behaviour significantly increases stock price crash risk and it is more\nsignificant in private companies. ESG report greenwashing and earnings management complement each other to increase the risk of stock price crash. Among companies that voluntarily disclose social responsibility information, ESG report greenwashing significantly increases the risk of stock price crash. The mediation mechanism test finds that information asymmetry is the mediating variable in the ESG report greenwashing affecting the risk of stock price crash.\n\nThe theoretical contribution of this paper lies in three aspects: First, this paper finds that ESG report greenwashing is a new stock price crash risk mechanism, which expands the stock price crash risk theory from the perspective of legitimacy. Stock price crash risk theory holds that management's motivation to hide negative information is based on career and compensation concerns (Ball, 2009; Jin & Myers, 2006), but the motivation of the ESG report greenwashing is to attract green investors to invest or maintain the legitimacy of companies (Lyon & Maxwell, 2011; Seele & Gatti, 2017). We supplement the theoretical motivation of stock price crash risk from the perspective of ESG report greenwashing. Furthermore, previous literature has found that management uses accruals management (Hutton et al. 2009), accounting conservatism (Kim & Zhang, 2016), comparability of financial statements (Kim et al. 2016), voluntary disclosure of social responsibility information (Kim et al. 2014) and other mechanisms to hide bad news. This paper finds that ESG report greenwashing is a new means of hiding bad news. Second, the literature on corporate social responsibility information and stock price crash risk is enriched from the perspective of ESG report greenwashing. Although many literatures have discussed the relationship between CSR/ESG disclosure and stock price collapse (Feng et al. 2022; Kim et al. 2014; Quan & Xiao, 2016; Song et al. 2017; Tian & Wang, 2017), but they simply take the quality of information disclosure as the research object and ignore the greenwashing behaviour in disclosure. This paper focuses on the \u2018inconsistency between words and deeds' in ESG. Third, the conclusion of this paper has important practical significance. Our findings provide external investors with a way to judge whether a company is greenwashing and empirical evidence on the stock price effects of ESG reporting greenwashing, which is helpful for external investors to make stock investment decisions. This study also provides empirical evidence that ESG report greenwashing increases the stock price crash risk for government departments, which has an important reference for the formulation of ESG information disclosure system and supervision work, and helps to maintain the stability of the capital market.\n\n## Institutional background, literature review and research hypothesis\n\n### Institutional background\n\nAt present, China has not introduced a special ESG report disclosure system, and the relevant disclosure requirements are mainly reflected in social responsibility reports. In September 2006, Shenzhen Stock Exchange took the lead in formulating and issuing the Guidelines on Social Responsibility of Listed Companies. In May 2008, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued the Notice on Strengthening the Social Responsibility of Listed Companies. On 31 December of the same year, it issued the Notice on Doing a Good Job in the 2008 Annual Report of Listed Companies, requiring sample companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the \u2018Shanghai Stock Exchange corporate governance\nsector', companies issuing foreign-funded shares listed overseas, financial companies and listed companies on the \u2018Shenzhen 100 Index' to disclose reports on fulfilling social responsibilities, for other companies, the principle of encouragement is applied. Environmental protection authorities also require listed companies or key pollutant dischargers in heavily pollution industries to disclose environmental information. Most listed companies adopt the principle of voluntary disclosure, while some are mandatory disclosure. On 30 September 2018, the CSRC issued a revised Code of Governance for Listed Companies, which requires listed companies to increase disclosure of corporate governance information in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. On 10 November 2018, Asset Management Association of China officially released the \u2018Research Report on ESG Evaluation System of Chinese Listed Companies' and \u2018Green Investment Guidelines (Trial)' to promote institutional investors to make ESG investments, serve the green development and transformation of the real economy, and achieve sustainable economic development.\n\n### Social responsibility information and stock price crash risk\n\nThe theory of the company's stock price crash risk holds that management has the motivation and ability to hide negative information due to information asymmetry and agency problems (Ball, 2009; Jin & Myers, 2006; Kim et al. 2016; Kothari et al. 2009), which ultimately triggers a stock price crash. Under information asymmetry, managers are prone to design accrual management (Hutton et al. 2009), accounting conservatism (Kim & Zhang, 2016), comparability of financial statements (Kim et al. 2016), and voluntary information disclosure such as social responsibility information disclosure (Kim et al. 2014) and other mechanisms to hide bad news, thereby increasing the risk of stock price crash.\n\nManagement takes advantage of voluntary disclosure of social responsibility information, may hide bad news or send signals to reduce information asymmetry, further affecting the risk of stock price crash. From the perspective of information asymmetry, the voluntary disclosure of CSR information can play a communication role, reduce information asymmetry and thus reduce the risk of stock price crash (Dai et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2014), that is the view of \u2018communication effect'. From the perspective of agency, the management takes CSR report as an egoistic tool, trying to cover up bad information with vague descriptions to convey a good corporate image to investors (Barnea & Rubin, 2010), that is, the view of \u2018disguise effect'.\n\nChina's social responsibility information disclosure system is a combination of mandatory disclosure and voluntary disclosure, and in this context, social responsibility information disclosure also reflects the above two effects. From the perspective of agency issues, Tian and Wang (2017) find the \u2018disguise effect' of mandatory social responsibility information disclosure. From the perspective of information asymmetry and investor sentiment, Song et al. (2017) believe that the information effect (communication effect) of social responsibility information disclosure reduces the risk of stock price crash. From the perspective of shareholders and management, Quan and Xiao (2016) believe that social responsibility information disclosure is an opportunistic behaviour of management and increases the stock price crash risk.\nIn 2018, the China Securities Regulatory Commission required listed companies to fully disclose ESG information on the basis of social responsibility reports, and the existing literature began to study the relationship between ESG information disclosure and stock price crash risk. ESG explicitly includes governance, while CSR indirectly includes governance issues related to environmental and social considerations. Therefore, ESG tends to be a broader term than CSR (Gillan et al. 2021). Feng et al. (2022) verify the communication effect of ESG information from the perspective of shareholders and find it reduce the risk of stock price crash. However, Murata and Hamori (2021) find that the ESG disclosure of American companies is not associated with stock price crash risk, while in Europe and Japan, ESG disclosure reduce the risk of stock price crash.\n\nThere are two reasons for the inconsistency of the existing research conclusions: first, there is an endogenous problem. There are measurement errors in social responsibility information. The social responsibility report scoring index of Runling Global Rating Agency has qualitative and quantitative indicators, the standards of qualitative and quantitative indicators are inconsistent, so it is difficult to accurately measure the social responsibility information with the total score calculated comprehensively. Moreover, it is not audited and its authenticity and reliability need to be tested. Second, the existing researches usually study stock price crash risk from a single dimension, either the disclosure of ESG report or the actual performance (rating) of ESG, but ESG report disclosure is not consistent with ESG actual performance (rating) (Christensen et al. 2022). Companies disclosing false ESG information to cover up relatively poor ESG performance are considered to be greenwashing (Yu et al. 2020). Therefore, the key to resolve the controversy of existing research is to study the impact of social responsibility information on the risk of stock price crash from the two different dimensions: ESG disclosure and ESG rating.\n\n### CSR/ESG report greenwashing\n\n### Definition of greenwashing\n\nGreenwashing is defined differently in different subject disciplines. For example, in the field of marketing, greenwashing is considered to be the behaviour of companies that mislead consumers in terms of environmental practices, environmental benefits of products or services (Delmas & Burbano, 2011). In the field of financial, greenwashing is regarded as an issuer who fraudulently made an environmental commitment at the time of issuance, but actually did not use the raised funds for sustainable development projects (Baldi & Pandimiglio, 2022). In the field of accounting, there are two main types of greenwashing: selective disclosure and expressive manipulation. Selective disclosure refers to the disclosure of information that is beneficial to the company in order to maintain a positive image of the company (Lyon & Maxwell, 2011). Expressive manipulation refers to the manipulation of understandable information by companies to influence the views of information recipients on companies (Brennan et al. 2009). Such companies often show the behaviour of \u2018more words and less actions' with more symbolic disclosures but less substantive actions (Walker & Wan, 2012). Cao et al. (2022) defined greenwashing as selective disclosure and descriptive manipulation based on previous studies.\n### Differences between social responsibility information greenwashing and ESG greenwashing\n\nUnder the background of implementing the \u2018double carbon' target policy, stakeholders such as government, institutional investors and financial institutions are increasingly concerned about the risks and opportunities brought by the ESG practice of companies. Institutional investors and financial institutions use ESG reports disclosed by listed companies to make investment and loan decisions. On the basis of CSR report disclosure, listed companies gradually transition to ESG report disclosure to meet the needs of institutional investors, financial institutions and other stakeholders. ESG reports contain more information about governance than CSR reports, which is related to the business objectives of companies (Gillan et al. 2021). At the same time, ESG reports disclose more quantitative non-financial data information, while most of the information disclosed in CSR reports is narrative and non-quantitative information. Therefore, ESG report greenwashing is different from social responsibility information greenwashing. Yu et al. (2020) defined greenwashing company as a company that disclosed a large amount of ESG data, but the ESG performance was poor. This paper refers to greenwashing's definition of Yu et al. (2020), and defines the ESG report greenwashing as that companies cover up relatively poor ESG performance by disclosing false ESG information.\n\n### The motivation and consequences of CSR or ESG report greenwashing\n\nThe existing research on the motivation of CSR greenwashing information mainly has two views: legitimacy and impression management. Based on legitimacy view, companies seek to obtain or maintain legitimacy by disproportionately disclosing beneficial or relatively benign performance indicators to mask their less impressive overall performance (Marquis et al. 2016). As Reber et al. (2022) argues that companies strive to achieve ESG performance and communicate their efforts to demonstrate that they comply with sustainability-related norms, thereby obtaining and maintaining a social business licence. Based on impression management view, in order to leave a \u2018good' impression on external stakeholders such as investors, companies selectively disclose positive information about social or environmental behaviour (Marquis et al. 2016). Greenwashing is a strategy for companies to pursue legitimacy, using impression management to communicate symbolically, rather than addressing these issues substantively in action (Gacek, 2020). Therefore, the core of both views is impression management.\n\n### The influence of CSR or ESG report greenwashing on a company's investment, performance and share price\n\nIf companies disclose unreliable environmental, social, and governance information, greenwashing can become an obstacle to ESG investment decisions (Yu et al. 2020). The impact of greenwashing on the company's stakeholders will eventually lead to a decline in financial performance, which is not conducive to investment (Pizzetti et al. 2021). However, there is little literature to study the impact of ESG report greenwashing on the risk of stock price crash.\n### Research hypothesis\n\nThe agency problem and the motivation of management to hide bad news under information asymmetry are both motivated by managers to gain personal benefits. However, ESG \u2018greenwashing' that hides bad news and discloses good news is to create a positive corporate image to gain stakeholder support and maintain corporate legitimacy (Lyon & Maxwell, 2011; Seele & Gatti, 2017). Once a company's ESG report greenwashing behaviour is exposed, the stock price falls. The main body of company ESG report greenwashing may be management or major shareholders. Therefore, ESG report greenwashing is a new research perspective to explain the risk of stock price crash. Based on ESG report greenwashing perspective, the analysis is carried out from three stages including managers' motivation to conceal ESG bad news, the mechanism and the process of exposure.\n\nESG report greenwashing is that management or major shareholders conceal negative non-financial information, and the motivation is for impression management to maintain corporate image or legitimacy. On one hand, ESG report greenwashing is based on the purpose of maintaining the legitimacy position of the company in order to gain the support of stakeholders, while management hiding negative financial information stems from typical agency problems, i.e. concern about position promotion, management compensation, potential dismissal, litigation risk, and reputation decline (Ball, 2009; Kothari et al. 2009). On the other hand, ESG report greenwashing is to create a positive corporate image (Lyon & Maxwell, 2011). Olatubosun and Nyazenga (2019) found that many companies have ESG symbolic greenwashing behaviours and impression management. Listed companies may strategically disclose voluntary information to achieve a particular purpose of the company or the managers themselves (Dai et al. 2019), and may selectively and incorrectly disclose ESG social responsibility information (Cho & Patten, 2007; Geerts, 2014; Lyon & Maxwell, 2011; McCrory & Langvardt, 2012), ESG disclosure \u2018greenwashing'. Regardless of the ESG report greenwashing motivation, if market participants find that a company has an ESG report greenwashing behaviours, they will be bearish on the stock price of the greenwashing company.\n\nThe management of ESG report greenwashing company have the ability to hide negative ESG information. ESG report greenwashing is a new mechanism to influence the stock price crash risk. Previous literature has found that management used accrual management (Hutton et al. 2009), accounting conservatism (Kim & Zhang, 2016), comparability of financial statements (Kim et al. 2016), voluntary disclosures such as social responsibility disclosures (Kim et al. 2014) and other mechanisms to hide bad news. Impression management theory suggests that the management of ESG report greenwashing companies have ability to use the mechanism of voluntary disclosure to hide negative ESG information, increasing information asymmetry and leading to an increased risk of stock price crash. Greenwashing is a corporate legitimacy-seeking strategy used to symbolically communicate with environmental issues rather than substantively address them in action (Gacek, 2020). Companies with high ESG scores are not necessarily true charities (Choi & Hong, 2022). On one hand, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) data provided in corporate sustainability reports are often unaudited, making it difficult for investors to judge the quality of ESG information. In the same industry, companies with high reputation are more likely to greenwash their ESG (Ruiz-Blanco\net al. 2022). This phenomenon makes it more difficult for investors to assess the quality of ESG social responsibility disclosures. The quality of a company's ESG disclosure makes it difficult to communicate company-specific risks to outside investors. On the other hand, there is no uniform disclosure regulation for ESG reports, and the disclosure standards vary from company to company, which facilitates management to hide poor ESG reports and leads to an increased information asymmetry between insiders (informed traders) and external investors (uninformed traders) of ESG report greenwashing companies, resulting in an increased risk of stock price crash.\n\nThe exposure of ESG report greenwashing behaviours leads to increased risk of stock price crash. Unlike greenwashing of a company's products or services, the purpose of ESG report greenwashing is to preserve corporate image and legitimacy (Lyon & Maxwell, 2011; Seele & Gatti, 2017). Greenwashing of a company's products or services is easily exposed by consumers, the media and regulators. ESG report greenwashing have a greater invisibility due to information asymmetry. Compared with consumers, media and regulators, capital market participants always pay attention to the ESG behaviour of listed companies, they can identify false ESG reports before the negative information exposure. Previous literature suggests that management hoards negative bad news and when the accumulated bad news eventually exceeds a critical threshold, managers immediately release all the bad news, leading to a stock price crash (Jin & Myers, 2006). In fact, it is rare for listed companies to automatically release bad news, and most companies passively expose bad news because of CSRC penalties or revelations by capital market participants such as investors. Capital market participants can analyse the inconsistency between ESG disclosure and actual ESG performance of a company, and expose the ESG report greenwashing behaviour of a company. If investors know that a company has ESG report greenwashing behaviour, they will underestimate the stock price of that company. Based on the above reasons, our first hypothesis is as follows: H1:All else being equal, ESG report greenwashing increases the stock price crash risk for greenwashing companies.\n\nNext, we examine whether ESG report greenwashing can be used as a supplement or substitute for earnings management in terms of its impact on stock price crash risk. It is well documented that earnings management is a mechanism for managers to hide bad news (Hutton et al. 2009), and ESG reports greenwashing is a new mechanism for managers to hide bad news that may complement or replace earnings management to increase the stock crash risk. The ESG reports greenwashing may be complementary to earnings management. On the one hand, when the company's earnings do not meet the management's expectations, the management applies impression management in the management's performance analysis and discussion report to mitigate the negative impact in this regard (Aerts & Cheng, 2011; Zhang & Aerts, 2015). If earnings management does not improve corporate impression management to the satisfaction of managers, managers may further supplement it by greenwashing ESG report, thus adding to the pile of bad news. On the other hand, companies selectively disclose social responsibility reports to cover up some misconduct (Hemingway & Maclagan, 2004). For example, management may choose to greenwash in order to cover up earnings management (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2021),\nfurther exacerbating the risk of stock price crash. Therefore, companies with high earnings management may also greenwash ESG report. The combination of the two makes enterprises face more severe risk of stock price collapse.\n\nHowever, if management have a low-risk appetite, they will choose to greenwash ESG report. Because the legitimacy risk of ESG report greenwashing is less than earnings management. ESG report greenwashing plays an alternative role in influencing stock price crash risk. For example, companies choosing earnings management have a higher risk of litigation (DuCharme et al. 2004; Hsu et al. 2022), but bear a lower risk for social responsibility information that has not been normatively audited. Secondly, earnings management will only bring short-term benefits, which will be reversed in the subsequent period (Hsu et al. 2022), in contrast, corporate social responsibility is more of a long-term value (Dai et al. 2019), which leads management to be more inclined to disclose or even greenwash ESG reports. Finally, with the continuous improvement of accounting standards and the level of financial information supervision, it will be more and more difficult for companies to obtain benefits through earnings management, and then they will use ESG greenwashing to replace earnings management, making it a new trigger for stock price crash. Based on the above analysis, we propose the opposing hypothesis:\n\nThere is a certain complementary relationship between earnings management and ESG report greenwashing on the impact of stock price crash risk.\n\nThere is a certain substitutional relationship between earnings management and ESG report greenwashing on the impact of stock price crash risk.\n\nChinese listed companies currently follow two disclosure systems to disclose social responsibility information voluntary disclosure and mandatory disclosure. This paper considers the impact of ESG report greenwashing on the stock price crash risk from the perspective of social responsibility information disclosure system. The difference between mandatory disclosure and voluntary disclosure is that mandatory disclosure belongs to the category that must be disclosed according to the policy. Mandatory provisions are made in the structural framework, index content, application mode, etc. firms that follow mandatory disclosure are more standardised in the disclosure of ESG reports, and the disclosure of some quantitative indicators is not easy to manipulate. The management has less autonomy on whether to disclose (Li & Luo, 2016), thus reducing the opportunity for selective disclosure by the management. Therefore, companies under mandatory disclosure have less space to manipulate disclosure information, less content and items to selectively disclose, and the possibility of stock price crash caused by hiding bad news is relatively low. Compared with mandatory disclosure, voluntary disclosure does not have rigid requirements for disclosing specific information. The management can selectively disclose positive ESG information and retain negative information, which exacerbates\ninformation opacity and ultimately leads to a stock price crash (Xu et al. 2021). Based on the above analysis, we propose the following hypothesis:\n\n#### H3:\n\nCompared to companies under mandatory disclosure of social responsibility information, ESG report greenwashing have a more significant positive impact on stock price crash risk in voluntary disclosure companies.\n\n## Research design\n\n### Sample and data\n\nWe use a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2014 to 2021. We select this time interval because Chinese Academy of Sciences issued the Guidelines for the Preparation of CSR Reports of Chinese Companies in January 2014. There is a total of 25,852 firm-years data from 2014 to 2021, then we exclude the 2197 ST, ST* and PT samples, 762 financial service samples, 4695 samples with missing control variables, 6138 ESG disclosure and ESG performance data for which one is available and the other is missing samples and 881 samples that were required to make mandatory ESG reporting disclosure but for which both ESG disclosure and performance data were missing, to ensure as much as possible that companies with missing disclosure and performance data did not issue ESG reports. Finally, we obtain 11,179 firm-year observations as our research object. After the above processing, the samples in this paper can be divided into two categories, one is 1266 samples with both ESG disclosure and performance data. In the other category, there were 9,913 samples with neither.\n\nThe ESG performance and ESG information data in this paper are, respectively, from the Thomson Reuters Eikon datastream and Bloomberg databases, other data are from the CSMAR database. All continuous variables are winsorised at the 1% and 99% levels to eliminate the effect of outliers.\n\n### Variable measurement and model setting\n\nThe dependent variable Crash is the stock price crash risk, which are the one-period lagged negative return skewness coefficient (F.NCSKEW), and the one-period lagged return up/down volatility ratio (F.DUVOL), respectively. Following the research methods of Hutton et al. (2009) and Kim et al. (2014) to measure the stock price crash risk at the firm level, the specific indicators are the negative return skewness coefficient (NCSKEW) and the upward and downward volatility ratio of returns (DUVOL), respectively.\n\nThe independent variable is Greenwashing. We define ESG report greenwashing as the act of ESG performance not reaching the level stated in the ESG report, i.e. the act of using ESG report to whitewash ESG performance. Following Yu et al. (2020) and Zhang (2022), we use the difference between the industry-standardised ESG information disclosure score and the standardised ESG performance score to determine whether and to what extent a company greenwashes ESG information. The specific calculation formula is as follows: $$Greenwashing_{i} = \\frac{D_{i} - \\overline{D}}{\\sigma_{D}} - \\frac{P_{i} - \\overline{P}}{\\sigma_{P}}$$\nCHINA JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES\n\n#\n\nThe higher the value, the greater the degree of ESG report greenwashing. If the difference is positive, we can say there is a phenomenon of greenwashing in ESG information; otherwise, the company has not greenwashed ESG report. Among them, the ESG information disclosure rating provided by Bloomberg only reflects the amount of ESG data disclosed by the company to the public, but it does not measure company's ESG performance (Yu et al., 2020). The ESG performance rating provided by Thomson Reuters Eikon is often used to represent the company's real performance in terms of ESG (Rees &amp; Rodionova, 2015). Therefore, this measurement method is consistent with our definition of ESG report greenwashing, which can be used to accurately identify whether companies engage in greenwashing behaviours. In addition, the measurement requires that companies must have both ESG disclosure and performance scores. However, China does not mandate the disclosure of ESG information, the missing data for the large number of companies that do not disclose ESG information may affect the empirical conclusions. And according to our definition of ESG report greenwashing, failure to disclose ESG information also means that companies do not embellish their poor ESG performance through ESG reports, and the difference between standardised ESG disclosure and performance rating is 0. Therefore, the ESG report greenwashing index for this sample is assigned a value of 0. To make the empirical conclusion more significant, the 1,266 samples for which both ESG disclosure and performance data are available are treated as separate subsamples and subjected to an additional regression test.\n\nControl variables: With reference to the studies of Kim et al. (2014), Cao and Zhang (2020), we control the following variables: the independent variable of the current period\n\nTable 1.

In addition, we also control years (Year) and industries (Industry). The main variable definitions are provided in Table 1.\n\nFollowing Kim et al. (2014), Cao and Zhang (2020), we construct model (2) to test our assumptions:\n\n$$\nC r a s h _ {i, t + 1} = a _ {0} + a _ {1} G r e e n w a s h i n g _ {i, t} + a _ {i} \\sum C o n t r o l s _ {i, t} + \\varepsilon_ {i, t} \\tag {2}\n$$\n\n# 4.

The mean value of NCSKEW is  $-0.401$  and the median value is  $-0.366$ , which is less than the median and shows a leftward deviation, while the mean value of DUVOL  $-0.280$  is slightly greater than the median value  $-0.290$ . The standard deviation of NCSKEW and DUVOL is  $0.776 / 0.490$ , respectively. These large standard deviations indicate that the two measures of stock price collapse risk of the sample companies in the sample variables vary significantly. We find that the mean value of greenwashing in the whole sample is only  $4.2\\%$ , which is mainly due to the fact that companies with both ESG information data and\n\nTable 2.

It can be seen that the dependent variables F.NCSKEW and F.DUVOL are significantly and positively correlated with Greenwashing at the  $5\\%$  level in the whole sample regression; and the dependent variables F.NCSKEW and F.DUVOL are significantly and positively correlated with Greenwashing at the  $5\\%$  and  $10\\%$  levels, respectively, in the subsample. This paper also controls the firm's fixed effect to reduce endogenous. Because the fixed effect model requires great differences between samples, and there are many companies in the whole sample that have not issued ESG reports for many consecutive years whose greenwashing index are assigned to zero, so this paper uses sub-samples that do not include such companies to conduct the fixed effect regression test. Panel B is the test result, which is consistent with mixed regression. The regression result indicates that the of stock price crash risk is higher for companies that engage in ESG report greenwashing, and supports Barnea and Rubin's (2010) view on the masking effect of social responsibility information disclosure, which validates the hypothesis of this paper.\n\nTable 4.

If ESG report greenwashing complements (substitutes) earnings management to increase stock price crash risk, then the interaction term coefficient between ESG report greenwashing and earnings management should be significantly positive (negative).\n\nTable 4 shows the test results of the basic regression of H2. We choose the modified Jones model (ABACC) and DD model to measure the accrued profit earnings management. Columns (1) and (4) show the regression results of earnings management and stock price crash, which are basically consistent with previous results. The higher the earnings management, the higher the stock price crash risk. Columns (2) and (5) control for earnings management, excluding the impact of earnings management factors, and there is a significant positive correlation between ESG report greenwashing and stock price crash risk. Interaction terms (GR_ABACC and GR_DD) are further added to columns (3) and (6), and the coefficient of interaction terms is significantly positive, indicating that there is a complementary effect between ESG report greenwashing and earnings management. The regression results verify hypothesis 2a, which indicates that companies engaged in earnings management will also increase the demand for ESG report greenwashing to strengthen the purpose and effect of earnings management. Earnings management is to hide bad news of financial information, while ESG reporting is to hide bad news of non-financial information. When the sum of the bad news hidden by both exceeds a critical value, it will trigger a stock price crash.\n\nTable 5 shows the test results of the basic regression of hypothesis 3. We have defined the dumb variable disclosure system. If the company is applicable to the mandatory disclosure system, then assign the value to 0, otherwise assign the value to 1, and then group for regression. Table 5 reports the results of the basic regression test. Column (2) and (4) are the regression results of the voluntary disclosure sample, and the correlation coefficients of independent variables are significantly positive at the level of 5%, but not significant in the mandatory disclosure sample. The regression results verify H3, indicating\nthat companies that voluntarily disclose CSR information are more inclined to use selective disclosure methods to greenwash ESG reports, and the concealment of negative news significantly increases the risk of stock price crash. The content and items of selective disclosure are reduced for companies under mandatory disclosure of CSR information, and the space for expression manipulation is limited, which makes the impact of ESG report greenwashing on crash risk no longer significant.\n\n### Cross-sectional analysis of managerial motivation, ESG report greenwashing and stock price crash risk\n\nTo support our hypothesis that ESG report greenwashing increases the crash risk of firms, we examine the relationship between ESG report greenwashing and stock price crash risk under different internal and external governance scenarios. Existing studies suggesting that corporate governance inhibits ESG report greenwashing behaviour (Yu et al. 2020), while corporate governance reduces stock price crash risk by affecting the quality of corporate financial reporting (Andreou et al. 2016). Excluding the influence of internal and external corporate governance factors, we expect that managements reduce the incentives for ESG report greenwashing under good corporate governance.\n\nIn this paper, we consider both internal and external corporate governance aspects of the firm. Referring to Yu et al. (2020), we analyse the effect of internal governance on greenwashing in terms of both board size and institutional investor ownership, expecting that the managements inhibit the incentive to greenwash ESG reporting under good internal corporate governance. We divide the sample into high and low groups with median to test the regressions separately. And Panel A and B in Table 6 report the regression results. The results show that the correlation between greenwashing of ESG report and the stock price crash risk is not significant when the board size is larger and the shareholding of institutional investors is higher. This is consistent with the finding of Yu et al. (2020). Internal governance can play a governance role in ESG report greenwashing, and when the level of internal governance is high, managers have an incentive to discourage ESG report greenwashing, thus the positive effect on the risk of stock price crash is no longer significant.\n\nIn addition, different property rights may also affect the role of ESG reporting greenwashing on stock price crash risk. Compared with private companies, not only do state-owned companies receive more government support in finance and politics but managers of state-owned companies are less sensitive to performance (Jiang & Kim, 2015) and more enthusiastic about political pursuits. In contrast, private companies are a dominant equity structure, and major shareholders have greater motivation to greenwash ESG reports to obtain higher economic benefits. Therefore, this paper predicts that in the sample of private companies, ESG reporting greenwashing is significantly positively correlated with stock price crash risk, but not correlated in the sample of state-owned companies. Panel C examines the heterogeneity of the nature of property rights. The results are consistent with the hypothesis in this paper, and the regression coefficients of the ESG greenwashing index of private companies listed in (2) and (4) in Panel C are 0.1663 and 0.1086, both of which are significant at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively.

This is consistent with the conclusion of Li et al. (2022), indicating that under the pressure of high environmental regulations and high media attention, the ESG activities of companies are subject to more strict supervision, which makes the gap between the ESG communication\n\nTable 8.

Mediation mechanism test\n\nFull disclosure of ESG information by companies can reduce information asymmetry between companies and stakeholders, thereby significantly reducing the stock price crash risk (da Silva, 2022; Murata &amp; Hamori, 2021); Conversely, the higher the degree of information asymmetry, the greater the stock price crash risk (Hutton et al., 2009; Jin &amp; Myers, 2006). If companies greenwash ESG reports in order to hide bad news or deliberately create good news, stakeholders will be difficult to identify (Li et al., 2022), resulting in an increase in the degree of information asymmetry, and causing the stock price crash after the bad news cannot be hidden.\n\nReferring to the practice of Kim and Lim (2017), this paper uses the informed transaction probability (PIN) calculated by the EKO market microstructure model as an index to measure the degree of information asymmetry. The higher the probability of informed transaction, the greater the degree of information asymmetry. As shown in Table 8, ESG reporting greenwashing is significantly positively correlated with information asymmetry at the 5% level, indicating that ESG greenwashing increases the degree of information asymmetry between insiders (informed traders) and external investors (uninformed traders) of the company.\n\nTable 9.

LIU ET AL.\n\n## 4.5. Robustness tests\n\n### 4.5.1. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method\n\nDue to the self-selection bias of the sample, there are endogenous issues of ESG report greenwashing. On one hand, ESG report greenwashing is not a policy randomly assigned to listed companies, but a strategy that companies can choose on their own; on the other hand, whether companies implement ESG report greenwashing or not is influenced by internal and external factors. Since the number of companies in the greenwashing group in the subsample is 940, which is far more than the non-greenwashing group of 326, it is not suitable for PSM method, so this paper only performs PSM test on the whole sample, and we also use the greenwashing index of two institutions for regression test. According to Ruiz-Blanco et al. (2022), Velte (2021) and Delmas and Burbano (2011), greenwashing behaviour is related to company characteristics, earnings management, and market factors. Therefore, this paper has selected continuous variables Lev, Roa, Size, Sigma, Ret, ABACC, and DTURN for one-to-one nearest neighbour matching. The matched results are shown in Panel A in Table 9. The T-Tests are mostly insignificant after matching, and the bias is basically within 10%, indicating good matching results. The PSM regression results are shown in Table 9, and the greenwashing index calculated by both Reuters and MSCI agency ratings are significant with stock price crash risk at the 5% level, indicating that the basis regression test in this paper is robust.\n\nTable 10.

In this paper, the sample was selected by excluding those samples for which the ESG greenwashing index could not be calculated due to missing data, which resulted in biased estimation results. To deal with the effect of sample selection bias, we implement the Heckman two-stage method, and construct the following model: *P**r*(*G**r**e**e**n**w**a**s**h**i**n**g*_*d**u**m**m**y*_{*i*, *t*}=1)=*\u03d5*(*\u03b3**Z*_{*i*, *t*}) = *\u03b2*_{0} + *\u03b2*_{1}*A**Q**I*_{*i*, *t*} + *\u03b2*_{*i*}\u2211*C**o**n**t**r**o**l**s*_{*i*, *t*} + *\u03b5*_{*i*, *t*} *C**r**a**s**h*_{*i*, *t* + 1} = *\u03b2*_{0} + *\u03b2*_{1}*G**r**e**e**n**w**a**s**h**i**n**g*_{*i*, *t*} + *p**o**\u03bb*(*\u03b3**Z*_{*i*, *t*}) + *\u03b2*_{*i*}\u2211*C**o**n**t**r**o**l**s*_{*i*, *t*} + *\u03b5*_{*i*, *t*} To predict whether a firm has implemented greenwashing, we introduce an exogenous variable that may affect the firm's decision to make a greenwashing strategy in model (3): the air quality index (AQI) of the prefecture-level city where the firm is located. Air quality represents to a certain extent the pollution level of a city, and if the city where the firm is located is more polluted it may affect the firm's motivation to greenwashing, but it will not directly affect the firm's stock price collapse risk. The air quality index data is sourced from CSMAR, and a larger air quality index indicates worse air quality. The regression results are reported in Panel A in Table 10, which show that the correlation coefficient of AQI is significantly positive, indicating that the worse the true ESG performance of firms in cities with poor air quality, the more inclined they are to greenwashing.\n\nPanel B reports the regression results for model (4), the second stage. We find that the coefficient of Inverse Mills ratio in the whole sample is significantly positive, indicating that selection bias may indeed exist in the whole sample. After controlling for selection bias, the coefficient of Greenwashing is still significantly positive, and the conclusion is the same as the basis regression.\n\n### Other robustness tests\n\nThis paper also uses the following three methods to test robustness, and the results remain unchanged. This paper excludes the cross-listed \u2018A+H' and \u2018A+B' stocks, and conducts benchmark regression tests on the whole sample and subsamples, respectively.\n\nRating opinions of different rating agencies may be divergent (Christensen et al. 2022), and the conclusions drawn from data from only one rating agency are not convincing. We also recalculate the greenwashing index using ESG performance data from MSCI rating agencies. We substitute the independent variables with the above two measures and test again, the results are reported in Table 10, which show that our core hypothesis still valid even after replacing the greenwashing measures.\n\n## Conclusions and limitations\n\nBased on the perspective of non-financial information greenwashing, this paper studies the impact of ESG report greenwashing on the stock price crash risk. The findings reveal that the behaviour of ESG report greenwashing increases the stock price crash risk, and this effect is more obvious in companies that voluntarily disclose social responsibility information. This paper finds that ESG report greenwashing has a greater impact on stock\nprice crash risk in companies with high levels of earnings management. The relationship of earnings management and ESG report greenwashing is complementary. The cross-sectional analysis shows that effective internal governance and stringent environmental regulation will inhibit the motivation of management's ESG report greenwashing, while in the case of low media attention, the management's motivation of ESG report greenwashing is greater. Among private companies, ESG report greenwashing has a more significant impact on stock price crash risk. Mechanism analysis found that ESG report greenwashing intensified the information asymmetry between insiders and external investors, which increased the stock price crash risk.\n\nThis study also has theoretical and practical implications. On one hand, this paper finds a new mechanism of stock price crash risk from the perspective of non-financial information greenwashing, which is market participants revealing the bad ESG information hidden by the management. This finding expands and integrates the ESG report greenwashing theory and stock crash risk theory, enriches the literature on the relationship between social responsibility information disclosure and stock price crash risk. The original research on social responsibility disclosure and stock crash risk only measures social responsibility disclosure from a single dimension, such as Kim et al. (2014) using social responsibility rating data from MSCI ESG database. In contrast, this paper measures social responsibility information (ESG information) from two dimensions, ESG disclosure and ESG performance, which is a more accurate measurement and can avoid the measurement error issue to some extent. On the other hand, the results of this study also provide empirical evidence on the relationship between ESG report greenwashing and stock price crash risk for emerging market investors and regulatory authorities. It provides a reliable decision-making reference for the high-quality development of Chinese listed companies.\n\nThere are two main limitations of this paper: First, this paper uses the method of Yu et al. (2020) to measure the degree of greenwashing of ESG reports, but this measure may be subject to error. The reason for adopting this approach is that all ESG disclosure and rating data can be obtained from the database, and the disadvantage of subjectivity of textual analysis can be overcome. We also use the greenwashing index calculated by text analysis for robustness testing, but there may still be some errors. Second, due to the missing data of institutional ratings of some companies, some samples cannot be calculated for the greenwashing index, and this paper excludes these missing value samples and does robustness tests, which may have some impact on the generalisation of the conclusions. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately measure the greenwashing of ESG reports, and there is still much room for exploration, so subsequent studies can start from this and develop more accurate measurement methods.\n\n## Disclosure statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nCHINA JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES\n637\n\n# References\n\nAerts, W., &amp; Cheng, P.

Its main aim is to synthesize and organize the existing literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies. Drawing on a rigorous content analysis of 88 studies, we delineate strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and examine content-analysis-based measurement approaches used to detect it. Our SLR shows that most strategic typologies draw on theories such as legitimacy theory, impression management theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory. Several studies adopt a four-quadrant matrix with varying conceptual dimensions, while others classify strategic responses to institutional pressures along a passive-active continuum. However, the evidence suggests that to assume that companies uniformly pursue sustainability reporting strategies is a major oversimplification. The findings also indicate that the literature proposes a variety of innovative, content-analysis-based approaches aimed at capturing divergences between communicative claims and organizational realities\u2014most notably, discrepancies between disclosure and measurable performance, and between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions, as well as the identification of selective or manipulative communication practices that may signal greenwashing. Analytical techniques commonly focus on linguistic and visual cues in sustainability reports, including tone (sentiment and narrative framing), readability (both traditional readability indices and machine learning-based textual complexity measures), and visual content (selective emphasis, imagery framing, and graphic distortions). We also synthesize studies that document empirically verified instances of greenwashing and contrast them with research that, in our view, relies on overly simplified or untested assumptions. Based on this SLR, we identify central theoretical and methodological priorities for advancing the study of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and propose a research agenda to guide future research.\n\nKeywords: sustainability reporting; corporate greenwashing; greenwashing measurement; measurement approaches; strategic typologies; systematic literature review\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe concept of greenwashing began to gain wider attention in the late 1990s, with scholarly and public interest in the issue continuing to grow over the following decades [1].

It was originally applied to environmental issues and defined as \u201cthe intersection of two firm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive communication about environmental performance\u201d [3]. It was also referred to as \u201csymbolic corporate environmentalism\u201d [4]. Subsequently, the concept evolved into a broader interpretation, described as the \u201cselective disclosure of positive information about a company's environmental or social performance without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image\u201d [5] or the \u201cact of presenting a company's environmental and/or social performance in a misleading way\u201d [6]. Following the triple-bottom-line approach to sustainability and the principles of environmental integrity, social equity, and economic prosperity, addressing environmental, social, and economic issues has become essential to discussions of greenwashing [2].\n\nGreenwashing has been analyzed from various perspectives, with the literature presenting different conceptualizations of its relationship to similar notions. Some authors interpret it as a form of decoupling [7], highlighting the discrepancy between dissemination of symbolic statements (\u201ctalk\u201d) and actual actions (\u201cwalk\u201d) [8]. Others view greenwashing as a concept that describes decoupling processes within the context of sustainability, treating greenwashing and decoupling as synonyms [9,10,11]. Yet, Siano et al. [12] distinguish between two primary types of greenwashing: decoupling and attention deflection. In this context, decoupling refers to the gap between disclosure and performance [13] or between policy statements and actual corporate commitment [14], as well as the disconnection between means and ends [15]. It also includes impression management practices that involve \u201cempty green claims and policies\u201d and \u201csin of fibbing\u201d, in which companies make claims that are outright false [16]. Impression management encompasses emphasizing positive organizational outcomes (enhancement) or obfuscating negative organizational outcomes (concealment) [17].\n\nAttention deflection, as the act of concealing unethical business practices, encompasses various deceptive communication tactics, such as selective and inaccurate disclosure [5], including incomplete comparisons and vague or irrelevant statements [18]. It also involves misleading written texts and visual imagery [19] as well as unverifiable claims, such as implied superiority and the \u201csin of no proof\u201d, where assertions lack substantiating evidence or accessible supporting information [20].\n\nGreenwashing involves both the overstatement of positive performance and the concealment of negative information [21,22]. It encompasses a broad range of practices commonly characterized by the dissemination of misleading information [23], including various forms of false claims rooted in hypocrisy and/or deception [24]. Some authors connect greenwashing with the obfuscation of negative sustainability information, suggesting that companies with inferior sustainability performance use complex, ambiguous language to produce intentionally opaque or confusing reports [25]. This means that greenwashing can be identified through linguistic patterns, which often rely on overly optimistic terms that emphasize positive aspects. Accordingly, the literature on greenwashing is closely related to research on selective disclosure, in which favorable information is emphasized while unfavorable details are minimized or omitted [26].\n\nIn this paper, we refer to greenwashing in sustainability reporting as the deliberate or unintended dissemination of misleading, incomplete, or overly favorable sustainability-related disclosures. It is manifested through the selective presentation of positive information, the concealment or obfuscation of negative performance, or the decoupling of reported claims from underlying organizational practices. This process constructs an unjustifiably positive impression of corporate sustainability by overstating positive actions and concealing negative ones.\nThe complex and often ambiguous nature of greenwashing presents substantial methodological challenges for researchers attempting to identify and measure it. At the same time, these challenges offer valuable opportunities for future inquiry [27]. However, there remains a limited understanding regarding the strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and the approaches used to measure it, including their operationalization, methodologies, and data sources applied in this field [28]. In particular, approaches based on content analysis are especially valuable and offer significant conceptual and empirical insights, given that much of the existing research on greenwashing relies on indicators derived from secondary sources such as dedicated databases and specific ratings, which are not always transparent, are often binary, and may be arbitrary or highly autocorrelated. In fact, using composite ESG indicators derived from secondary sources typically provides only aggregated scores, obscuring which aspect of greenwashing is measured, reducing comparability across heterogeneous providers, and limiting replicability where access to commercial ESG databases is restricted [29,30,31].\n\nGrowing scholarly interest in greenwashing has resulted in the publication of several systematic literature reviews [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39] and bibliometric analyses that characterize the structure and trends in this scientific field [40,41,42,43]. Nonetheless, systematic literature reviews focusing specifically on the measurement of greenwashing [32] and greenwashing in sustainability reporting [44,45] remain scarce. This scarcity is particularly evident in relation to strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and to measurement approaches grounded in content-analysis studies.\n\nGiven these challenges and the rapidly expanding research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting, it is crucial to build on existing analyses to address persistent gaps and explore under-researched areas.\n\nThe main aim of this paper, therefore, is to systematically organize and synthesize the current literature, identify key research gaps, and outline directions for future studies in this field. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive syntheses to date of strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and provide an integrated, conceptually grounded overview of existing approaches and analytical techniques used to measure and detect greenwashing through content analysis. In particular, our systematic literature review aims to address the following research questions, which have not been sufficiently explored in existing research:What strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting have been identified in the literature?What content analysis--based measurement approaches are used to detect greenwashing in sustainability reporting?\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the research methodology. In Section 3, the results are presented and discussed. Section 4 identifies areas for future research and Section 5 provides concluding remarks and acknowledges the study's limitations.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\nWe conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to address the research questions outlined in the introduction. As a rigorous and structured research method, an SLR facilitates a comprehensive examination of scholarly works within a specific research domain. This approach enables the mapping and synthesis of existing knowledge while providing insight into the interconnections among studies. Furthermore, it supports the identification, classification, and critical evaluation of the current body of literature, thereby establishing a foundation for recognizing research gaps and proposing future research directions [28,35,46,47].\nThe SLR presented in this study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines [48]. The review utilized the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection databases, selected for their reliability, relevance, and frequent use in systematic reviews [35,49]. In addition, these databases are the most widely used citation indexes in the world, and, consequently, most bibliometric and scientometric tools are based on them [50,51].\n\nTo improve methodological robustness, the selection of search terms was informed by a comprehensive review of previous SLRs and bibliometric analyses on greenwashing [28,35,36,37,39], sustainability reporting [52,53,54,55], and research integrating both topics [45]. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the research field, a thorough search was conducted using keywords that combined terms related to greenwashing and sustainability reporting.\n\nFirst, we created a list of terms describing greenwashing activities, which included the following keywords: \u201cgreenwash\u201d, \u201cgreen wash\u201d, \u201cgreen-wash*\u201d, \u201cdecoupling\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d, \u201cobfuscation\u201d, and \u201cdeceptive\u201d.\n\nSecond, given the diverse terminology used in extensive sustainability reporting research, a detailed search was conducted using keywords such as \u201csustainability report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201csustainable development report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccorporate social responsibility report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cCSR report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cresponsib* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cESG report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccorporate citizenship report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ctriple bottom line report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cTBL report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGRI report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGlobal Reporting Initiative report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201csustainable development goal* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cSDG* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cintegr* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cnon-financ* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cenvironm* report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cgreen report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cGHG report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201cgreenhouse gas report*/disclosure\u201d, \u201ccarbon report*/disclosure\u201d, and \u201csocial report*/disclosure\u201d.\n\nThe list of query words and the combined query string used in this study are provided in Table A1 and Table A2 in the Appendix A.\n\nNext, we defined the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review (Table A3 in the Appendix A). A study was considered eligible if the publication explicitly addressed the phenomenon of greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting as a primary research topic. In addition, the study had to discuss greenwashing strategies or methods for measuring greenwashing that were grounded in content analysis of sustainability reporting. We also specified that each study must operationalize at least one dimension of greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability reports or other corporate disclosures containing ESG-related information.\n\nFor the exclusion criteria, we omitted publications not written in English, reflecting the dominance of English in scientific communication [56] and reducing language and translation bias [28,57]. We also excluded books, book chapters, editorial materials, meeting abstracts, and data papers, as these document types typically do not undergo a rigorous peer-review process that ensures the reliability and credibility of empirical findings [58]. This approach is standard in many SLRs [28,49]. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table A3 in the Appendix A.\n\nThe search was conducted on 17 February 2025, utilizing the query string detailed in Table A2 in the Appendix A. After applying the initial exclusion criteria outlined in phase 1 (document type and language), 249 publications were identified in Scopus and 199 in WoS, resulting in a combined total of 448 records. Following the removal of 174 duplicate records from the two databases, the final dataset consisted of 274 unique publications. To organize key information throughout the process and to facilitate the identification and elimination of duplicates, we used a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\n\nIn the subsequent screening stage, the titles, abstracts, and keywords of the 274 publications were reviewed by two researchers (the co-authors) to assess their relevance to the\nstudy's objectives and determine eligibility for further analysis and data extraction. Each researcher independently screened all 274 publications to evaluate whether greenwashing in the context of sustainability reporting constituted the primary focus of the article. They also assessed whether the study involved an empirical examination of greenwashing in corporate reporting in line with the predefined scope of the review. Based on these criteria, each publication was classified as either \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cexclude.\u201d In cases where a researcher\u2014after reviewing the title, keywords, and abstract\u2014was uncertain about whether a publication met the inclusion criteria, it was conservatively classified as \u201cinclude\u201d and was retained for full-text assessment in the next stage. To evaluate inter-rater (inter-coder) reliability for the binary inclusion/exclusion decision, the reviewers' assessments were compared and Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient was high (\u03ba = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78--0.91), indicating strong agreement between the two reviewers [59,60]. In cases where discrepancies between the researchers' decisions occurred, the publication was retained for full-text review in the next stage. As a result of this phase, 182 publications were retained for the research sample, while 92 were excluded as not relevant to the review's objectives. Full texts were subsequently retrieved for the 182 included studies. Only 4 publications could not be obtained. Additionally, 21 publications were identified through the snowballing method.\n\nIn the next stage, 178 publications identified through database searches and 21 additional publications identified via snowball sampling were subjected to in-depth full-text analysis. The same two researchers independently reviewed the full texts, applying inclusion criteria derived directly from the research questions: (1) the article discussed greenwashing strategies in the context of sustainability reporting as a central topic, or (2) the study presented and empirically applied at least one content-analysis-based approach to measuring greenwashing. Publications were excluded if greenwashing strategies or measurement approaches were addressed only tangentially, if no methods or approaches based on content analysis of sustainability reports or other ESG-related disclosures were presented or applied, or if all dimensions of greenwashing were operationalized exclusively through external ESG scores from global financial or non-financial data vendors. Inter-coder decisions were again compared, and Cohen's kappa was recalculated. Agreement for full-text eligibility reached 88% (95% CI: 0.81--0.95), indicating an almost perfect level of agreement [59,60]. In cases of disagreement, both researchers re-examined the publication, discussed their assessments, and reached a joint decision. Following this process, 88 publications were retained for further analysis (76 identified through database searches and 12 identified via snowball sampling).\n\nTo provide a clearer understanding of the process of searching and including publications in this review, the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.\n\nIn the final step of the SLR, a thematic content analysis was conducted to extract and synthesize data relevant to the research questions. A narrative synthesis approach was applied, combining systematic textual summarization with interpretive analysis of the findings, as appropriate given the objectives of this review [61,62]. Two researchers independently reviewed and coded the full texts of all publications to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. A combined deductive--inductive coding strategy was used. At the deductive level, the coding framework was structured around two main thematic groups of studies, corresponding to the research questions: (1) articles addressing strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting and (2) articles presenting and applying content-analysis-based approaches and analytical techniques for measuring greenwashing.\n\nWithin each thematic group, additional codes were developed inductively to capture recurring concepts and patterns emerging from the material. For studies classified in the first group (strategic typologies), we coded the following elements: authorship,\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nthe theoretical framework(s) used, research sample characteristics, and the characteristics of strategic approaches. For studies classified in the second group (measurement approaches), we coded the following elements: authorship, the measurement approach or analytical technique used, research sample characteristics, the type of data, the method of data acquisition, and the sustainability focus of the measurement (environmental, social, and/or governance).\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for SLR of research on greenwashing in sustainability reporting. Source: Authors' elaboration based on [48].\n\nAll codes were documented in a shared Excel spreadsheet, which was used to organize, structure, and synthesize the extracted information and to compile Tables A4 and A5 in the Appendix A, providing a structured overview of the coded variables. Discrepancies\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nin coding between the two researchers were resolved through discussion, and any agreed refinements of the coding scheme were applied consistently across all publications.\n\nFigure 2 presents the quantitative descriptive characteristics of the analyzed publications, while the following section reports the results of the qualitative content analysis for the two thematic groups. Detailed characteristics of the studies included in the SLR are provided in Table A4 and Table A5 in the Appendix A. It should be noted that some publications addressed both thematic areas (i.e. they proposed a strategic typology and, at the same time, developed or applied a content-analysis-based measurement approach).\n\nIn addition, to evaluate the methodological quality and transparency of the review process, the PRISMA 2020 checklist was completed, and compliance with its 27 reporting items was verified (Table S1 in the Supplementary Material).\n\n## 3. Results and Discussion\n\nThis section presents the main findings of the SLR on greenwashing in sustainability reporting. It synthesizes key strategic typologies, content-analysis--based measurement approaches, and analytical techniques used to identify greenwashing. By integrating theoretical, methodological, and empirical insights, the section elucidates how greenwashing has been conceptualized, operationalized, and evidenced across the extant literature.\n\n### 3.1. Strategic Typologies of Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting\n\nResearch on strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting primarily draws on legitimacy theory, impression management theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory.\n\nMost existing typologies are structured around a four-quadrant matrix but differ in the dimensions considered. Amores-Salvad\u00f3 et al. [63] developed a model of four distinct strategic positions by comparing environmental performance and disclosure relative to industry averages. They identify two coherent approaches\u2014green leaders and blackbirds\u2014and two incoherent ones: green quiets (representing brownwashing) and green parrots (indicative of greenwashing). Kurpierz and Smith [64] refined Delmas and Burbano's [3] greenwashing typology by focusing on the truthfulness of claims (true/false) and their consequences (harm/no harm), thereby deconstructing greenwashing into a harm/no-harm dichotomy that differentiates between fraudulent practices and \u201ccheap talk.\u201d Cooper and Wang [65] analyzed the relationship between reported policy and activities addressing refugee needs. They categorized corporations into four types\u2014reactionary,\nrecurring, relevant, and revelatory\u2014based on the consistency of refugee programming over time and the degree of alignment between programs, policies, and impacts.\n\nIn another approach, strategic responses to institutional influences in sustainability reporting have been classified along a continuum from passive to active. Acquiescence represents the most passive strategy, manipulation the most active, while compromise, avoidance, and defiance fall in between [66].\n\nVarious typologies are derived from impression management theory. Talbot and Barbat [67] identified four impression management strategies in mining companies' CSR reports aimed at neutralizing and obscuring negative information on water performance. These include two data manipulation strategies\u2014strategic omission and obfuscation\u2014used to conceal noncompliance and poor performance, and two defensive strategies\u2014minimizing environmental impact and relativizing poor environmental performance\u2014employed to legitimize negative aspects. Leung and Snell [68] found that gambling companies use five camouflaging-based disclosure strategies\u2014zero disclosure, curtailment, disclamation, defensive fa\u00e7ades, and assertive fa\u00e7ades\u2014involving impression management to selectively maintain moral legitimacy amid shifting institutional expectations. Drawing on an analysis of communication strategies employed by Spanish listed companies regarding the SDGs, Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez et al. [69] revealed the use of legitimization strategy alongside proactive and defensive impression management approaches. The proactive approach focused on congratulation, self-promotion, and organizational promotion, while the defensive approach addressed negative situations through excuses, justifications, and apologies.\n\nIn the context of signaling theory and legitimization strategies, Hahn and L\u00fclfs [70], drawing on the concepts of symbolic and substantive management of legitimacy, identified six specific strategies for disclosing negative aspects in sustainability reports: marginalization, abstraction, indication of facts, rationalization (instrumental and theoretical), authorization, and corrective action (type 1 and type 2). Saber and Weber [71] subsequently applied the same framework and typology. Yuan et al. [72] identified three distinct greenwashing strategies: exaggerating, referring to the gap between actual performance and disclosure; distracting, highlighting the gap between strengths and concerns; and window-dressing, addressing the gap between materiality and immateriality. Leung and Snell [73] further revealed that companies in controversial industries, such as gambling, often engage in symbolic manipulation rather than substantive CSR, aiming to alter perceptions of corporate identity by emphasizing pragmatic legitimacy, diverting attention from moral legitimacy issues, and manipulating cognitive symbols. Finally, Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero et al. [74] found that companies with superior CSR performance tend to use high-quality CSR reporting to highlight achievements (enhancement strategy), offering more comparable and reliable information. In contrast, companies with poorer CSR performance often employ low-quality reporting to obscure actual performance (obfuscation strategy), providing information that is less balanced, accurate, and clear.\n\nWhile some researchers emphasize the exaggerated optimism in sustainability communications, others focus on the defensive strategies employed by companies. Laskin and Mikhailovna Nesova [26] demonstrated that sustainability reports are characterized by pronounced optimism, as they employ a higher frequency of positively charged linguistic elements\u2014such as praise, satisfaction, and inspiration\u2014while reducing the use of negatively charged expressions such as blame, hardship, and denial. Megura and Gunderson [75] identified subtle forms of climate change denial in the sustainability reports of fossil fuel companies, manifested as ideological denialism, greenwashing, and reification. Moreover, they observed various forms of greenwashing used to manipulate stakeholder perceptions within climate-related narratives, including techno-optimism, compliance,\ncountermeasures, and omission. Laufer [76] argued that companies use defensive strategies to protect themselves from liability, both internally and externally, with greenwashing relying on three key elements of deception: confusion, fronting, and posturing. Companies sometimes engage in strategic silence, with sustainability reports omitting concrete strategies for managing or curbing overproduction\u2014a form of vagueness recognized as a signal of greenwashing [77]. Research by Roszkowska-Menkes et al. [9] identified the selective disclosure of negative events in sustainability reporting, manifested in three forms: vague disclosure, avoidance, and hypocrisy. In addition, Gentile and Gupta [78] identified several strategies adopted by leading global fossil fuel companies, including necessitarianism; greenwashing, manifested through claims of sustainability, strategic wording, overstated commitments, half-truths, the use of \u2018net-zero' as a marketing label, and avoidance of critical issues (\u2018the elephant in the room'); strategic blame placement; and techno-optimism.\n\nConsidering how visual elements can be leveraged to influence CSR reports, Friedel [79] emphasized the strategic use of images and text and their impact on the perceived objectivity and construction of truth, highlighting how corporate myths are created and maintained to enhance organizational legitimacy. Additionally, Cho et al. [80] and C\u00fcre et al. [81] investigated corporate manipulation of graphs in sustainability reporting and identified two impression management strategies\u2014enhancement and obfuscation\u2014evidenced by the selective presentation of graphical data emphasizing favorable trends and the inclusion of material distortions within the graphs.\n\nResearch shows that to assume that companies adopt uniform sustainability reporting strategies is a significant oversimplification. Moreover, ESG practices are driven by diverse motivations, including strategic, altruistic, and greenwashing-related incentives [82]. Schons and Steinmeier [10] argue that companies can adopt strategies that combine symbolic and substantive CSR actions. This means that some of them may choose not to engage in CSR at all\u2014either symbolically or substantively\u2014and then they are referred to as Neglectors. Other companies may decide to focus primarily on symbolic actions (Greenwashers), who follow a \u201cmere talk\u201d strategy, or on substantive actions (Silent Saints), who adopt a \u201cmere walk\u201d strategy. Finally, some companies may demonstrate high levels of both symbolic and substantive engagement, acting as Balanced Engagers who \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. Siano et al. [12] argued that the simple distinction between talk and action is insufficient. Following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, they expanded the greenwashing taxonomy\u2014originally encompassing decoupling and attention deflection\u2014by identifying a new form of irresponsible behavior, namely \u201cdeceptive manipulation,\u201d in which sustainability communication is deliberately used to manipulate actual business practices. Furthermore, Cho et al. [83] argued that more diverse and nuanced theoretical perspectives are needed to understand sustainability reporting, as conflicting societal and institutional pressures can force companies to engage in organizational hypocrisy by creating and maintaining discrepant fa\u00e7ades, such as rational, progressive, and reputational.\n\nConsidering research on strategic typologies of greenwashing in sustainability reporting, most studies in this domain can be viewed as extending or complementing one another rather than offering contradictory insights. Apparent inconsistencies typically stem from scholars examining different dimensions of greenwashing\u2014for instance, exaggerated optimism versus subtle forms of denial, or text-based versus visual communication strategies. Moreover, the literature has evolved from simple 2 \u00d7 2 typologies toward more sophisticated frameworks that either position strategic responses to institutional pressures along a passive--active continuum or conceptualize varying forms and degrees of obfuscation or deception.\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nTable 1 summarizes the strategic approaches and conceptual positions of greenwashing identified in sustainability reporting. A detailed description of the underlying studies is provided in Table A4 in the Appendix A.\n\nTable 1.

Disclosure-Performance Gap Approach\n\nOne of the main approaches used to measure greenwashing in sustainability reporting focuses on the discrepancy between sustainability disclosure (D) and actual sustainability performance (P). Within this framework, researchers quantify ESG disclosure (i.e., what companies communicate about their sustainability actions) separately from ESG performance (i.e., what companies actually achieve). Greenwashing is thus conceptualized as the difference, imbalance, or misalignment between these two constructs. This approach builds on the \"talk-walk gap\" perspective, which assumes that companies may deliberately overstate their sustainability commitments when actual performance fails to support the communicated narrative.\n\nIn accordance with the inclusion criteria adopted in this review, the analyzed sample consists exclusively of studies in which at least one component of greenwashing measurement\u2014disclosure and/or performance\u2014is derived from content analysis of sustainability-related reports. While content analysis is most frequently applied to capture the scope and characteristics of sustainability disclosure [1,11,23,84-94], the sample also includes studies in which both disclosure and performance measures are extracted from sustainability report content and subsequently coded using predefined analytical schemes [95-99].\n\nVarious methods have been employed to quantify sustainability disclosure. The most prevalent approach involves counting the frequency of environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) keywords and normalizing these counts by the total word count of sustainability reports [23,84,88]. Some studies further refined this approach by weighting ESG terminology according to its contextual relevance or importance [86,97-99], or by assigning differentiated weights to monetary, quantitative, and purely narrative statements\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nto assess disclosure precision, with financial data considered the most credible form of evidence [1]. Some studies have used advanced natural language processing techniques to quantify ESG disclosures, combining content extraction with sentiment analysis [87,91,92,93,94].\n\nBeyond quantitative text metrics or sentiment indicators, several studies operationalized disclosure through checklist-based assessments, identifying the presence or absence of specific sustainability elements, typically coded in binary form [11,85,89,90,95,96]. In addition, environmental disclosure has also been quantified using self-reported environmental data submitted to external registries, treating reported quantities as indicators of environmental transparency [7,100].\n\nIn the reviewed studies, sustainability performance was most frequently quantified using external ESG scores provided by established global financial and non-financial data vendors, including Bloomberg [1,85,91], Refinitiv (now LSEG Data) [23], MSCI KLD STAT [11,93], CNRDS [88,92], HEXUN-RKS [90,94] and KOSPI200 [86]. Lagasio [87] also employed a normalized ESG score to assess greenwashing, although the data source for this metric was not explicitly specified. In several studies, environmental performance indicators were obtained directly from external operational data registries, most commonly from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported to regulatory authorities and environmental agencies [7,89,100].\n\nIn the remaining group of studies, ESG performance was derived through content analysis of sustainability reports. These studies constructed checklist-based assessments of indicators aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework or specific ESG actions. Quantitatively verified practices were distinguished from qualitative descriptions, with greater weight assigned to evidence supported by measurable or verifiable data [84,95,96,97,98,99].\n\nAn overview of methods used to operationalize ESG disclosures and performances is presented in Table 2.\n\nIn the analyzed studies, greenwashing is primarily conceptualized as the discrepancy between companies' communicated sustainability claims and their actual sustainability performance. Accordingly, empirical measurement typically relies on discrepancy-based indicators, expressed either as the difference between ESG disclosure levels and ESG performance levels [1,88,90] or as the ratio of disclosed ESG items to implemented sustainability actions [23].\n\nMore advanced studies develop customized indicators that integrate cognitive and linguistic dimensions of sustainability communication. For instance, Kim et al. [86] define greenwashing as the difference between text-weighted ESG disclosure scores\u2014which capture the depth and materiality of sustainability language\u2014and ESG performance. Kim and Lyon [7] measure greenwashing as the deviation between declared and actual emission reductions, normalized by declared reduction levels to control for firm-size effects. Similarly, Lagasio [87] constructs an \u201cESG-washing\u201d metric by subtracting standardized sustainability performance scores from sentiment-based ESG disclosure indices. Lee and Raschke [23] compute the ratio of textual ESG performance communication to standardized Refinitiv ESG scores to capture the communicative exaggeration of performance. Li et al. [96] likewise calculate greenwashing as the discrepancy between standardized indices of green communication (GCI) and green practices (GPI), reflecting overstated communication relative to actual initiatives. Finally, Zhou and Chen [97] and Zhou et al. [98,99] operationalize greenwashing as the standardized disparity between weighted textual disclosure indices and quantified environmental performance indicators, offering a multidimensional representation of disclosure--performance misalignment.\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nTable 2.

[99]  |\n\nIn summary, methods for measuring greenwashing through content analysis of sustainability disclosures and performance consistently draw on the notion of the \"talk-walk gap,\" but operationalize it in different ways, thus yielding different analytical insights. Checklist-based indices provide transparency and close alignment with reporting standards but are highly labor-intensive and limited in scalability. Keyword-frequency approaches offer strong scalability but primarily measure the volume of ESG communication, which can lead to inflated perceptions of disclosure quality. More advanced approaches\u2014such as quality-weighted metrics, sentiment analysis, and broader NLP techniques\u2014more effectively capture discrepancies between communication and actual performance, but they require specialized tools and expertise, and their outputs may diverge from those produced by simpler measures. On the performance side, ESG ratings, hard ESG indicators, and checklist-based indices capture distinct facets of sustainability, resulting in varying assessments of the same companies. ESG ratings face additional challenges due to methodological opacity, dependence on corporate disclosures, and inconsistency across providers. Overall, the evidence suggests that disclosure and performance measures should be viewed as complementary: differences between them reflect the multidimensional nature of greenwashing rather than measurement error.\n\n# 3.2.2. Symbolic and Substantive Disclosure Approach\n\nThe second methodological approach conceptualizes greenwashing as the distinction between symbolic and substantive sustainability disclosures, determined by the credibility, specificity, and verifiability of the information provided. Within this framework, it is assumed that companies may use sustainability rhetoric as a means of gaining legitimacy by emphasizing broad commitments or aspirational claims that are not substantiated by verifiable actions, measurable outcomes, or tangible resource allocations. Consequently,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\ncontent analysis of sustainability reports is used to identify the nature of corporate sustainability activities, classify them as symbolic or substantive, and assess the potential imbalance between these two dimensions in sustainability reporting. From this perspective, greenwashing is operationalized as a predominance of symbolic content over substantive information [101,102,103]. However, it should be emphasized that symbolic communication should not, in all contexts, be treated as synonymous with greenwashing. It constitutes greenwashing only when it systematically substitutes for or obscures substantive information, rather than when it coexists with reliable, performance-based disclosure [6,30,103,104].\n\nSymbolic actions (often referred to as green talk) occur when a company makes claims or discloses information about social or environmental initiatives that are not actually implemented in practice [24]. Such symbolic disclosures tend to be broad, predominantly positive, and typically lack measurable evidence or verifiable outcomes. In contrast, substantive actions (green walk) refer to disclosures describing initiatives that have been materially implemented and have produced tangible, verifiable impacts. In other words, whenever a company provides detailed and evidence-based information about a specific action, or when the accuracy of its claims can be verified, the disclosure is considered substantive [24].\n\nAlthough the symbolic--substantive distinction is the most widely used conceptualization in the literature, several authors employ alternative terminology to describe comparable phenomena. For example, Khan et al. [104] differentiate between cosmetic and organic efforts, where cosmetic efforts rely on rhetorical strategies and attention-grabbing narratives that superficially frame positive environmental performance, whereas organic actions reflect credible and meaningful initiatives supported by concrete evidence. Xing et al. [102] distinguish between soft and hard sustainability disclosures, with soft disclosures referring to claims without strong objective evidence, typically compiled by companies themselves, and hard disclosures based on quantitative data that can be verified by other institutions. Despite the different terminology, these studies share a common assumption: symbolic communication reflects declarative or aspirational expressions of commitment, while substantive actions provide verifiable evidence of actual progress towards sustainability.\n\nOur SLR revealed that most authors applied checklist-based classification schemes to distinguish between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions. This method relies on predefined lists of sustainability-related issues or actions, where each disclosed item is coded as symbolic or substantive depending on its level of detail, quantification, and verifiability. For example, Xing et al. [102] developed a checklist consisting of 16 soft and 79 hard disclosure items, representing narrative versus evidence-based information. Khan et al. [104] constructed a checklist of 14 items assessing the reliability (organic actions) and relevance (cosmetic actions) of information presented in sustainability reports. Li et al. [101] identified 8 elements characterizing symbolic actions and 6 describing substantive ones. Van der Ploeg and Vanclay [6] employed a ten-question checklist to assess whether reports provided balanced information, including negative environmental impacts, arguing that a high proportion of descriptive over data-supported disclosures indicates potential symbolic legitimation strategies. Zhang et al. [105] proposed a checklist of 19 environmental disclosure items, specifying criteria for classifying each disclosure or corporate activity as symbolic or substantive. Subsequently, Zhang et al. [106] expanded this framework to 22 indicators, while Zhang et al. [107] further incorporated additional evidence such as certifications and quantified environmental achievements. Similarly, Xu et al. [103] applied a 17-item checklist addressing the readability, reliability, and completeness of sustainability disclosures, defining explicit criteria for categorizing statements as symbolic or substantive.\n\nA slightly different approach to classifying corporate sustainability actions as symbolic or substantive was proposed by Costa et al. [108]. The authors employed the Global\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\nReporting Initiative (GRI) framework to identify and categorize disclosure indicators. Based on these standards, they developed a checklist of GRI indicators and subsequently evaluated each disclosure item in sustainability reports to determine whether it was presented in a narrative (symbolic) form or as verifiable quantitative or performance-based (substantive) information.\n\nIn several studies, a linguistic-textual classification was applied to distinguish between symbolic and substantive sustainability actions. For example, Khalil and O'Sullivan [24] differentiated between the two by examining the linguistic structure of ESG narratives, including the number of sentences and words related to environmental and social topics, under the assumption that a higher proportion of symbolic expressions indicates a greater likelihood of greenwashing. Similarly, Huq and Carling [30] utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify the number of substantive greenhouse gas (GHG) disclosures included in sustainability reports, interpreting a low proportion of evidence-based statements as indicative of symbolic reporting and potential greenwashing.\n\nAn overview of methods used for operationalizing greenwashing in sustainability reporting based on symbolic and substantive dimensions is presented in Table 3.\n\nTable 3. Methods for Operationalizing Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Based on Symbolic and Substantive Dimensions.\n\n|  Type of Method | Author  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Checklist-based manual classification | Khan et al. [104]; Li et al. [101]; Van der Ploeg and Vanclay [6]; Xing et al. [102]; Xu et al. [103]; Zhang et al. [105]; Zhang et al. [106]; Zhang et al. [107]  |\n|  GRI-indicator-based classification | Costa et al. [108]  |\n|  Linguistic-textual classification | Huq and Carling [30]; Khalil and O'sullivan [24]  |\n\nOur analysis indicates that, within this group of studies, greenwashing was most frequently quantified as the discrepancy between symbolic and substantive sustainability disclosures [101,102,105,108] or as the ratio of symbolic to substantive elements in sustainability reporting [103,106,107]. Some researchers examined this phenomenon indirectly through disclosure quality indicators, where a greater emphasis on relevance (cosmetic efforts) relative to reliability (organic efforts) was interpreted as indicative of symbolic reporting and potential greenwashing [104]. Other studies identified greenwashing through the dominance of symbolic disclosures over substantive ones [24,30], or by observing a prevalence of declarative statements (symbolic actions) over verifiable data (substantive actions) [6]. Collectively, these findings suggest that symbolic sustainability communication not supported by verifiable progress may serve as a deliberate impression management strategy, representing greenwashing in corporate sustainability reporting.\n\nAlthough all methods aim to detect the gap between symbolic and substantive disclosures, they operationalize this gap differently. Manual approaches provide detailed, context-sensitive assessments but are highly time- and resource-intensive. Automated methods (e.g., NLP, text mining) enable large-scale analysis and efficient analysis but may overlook subtle linguistic and contextual nuances. These approaches are therefore best seen as complementary: manual coding can be used to train and validate automated tools, thereby combining interpretive accuracy with computational scale. The optimal method ultimately depends on research objectives and resource constraints\u2014automated techniques are well suited for large cross-sectional studies, whereas manual checklists are preferable for in-depth analyses of individual reports or small samples.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\nSustainability 2026, 18, 17\n\n# 3.2.3. Selective and Manipulative Disclosure Approach\n\nA third approach to measuring greenwashing in sustainability reporting focuses on how companies present ESG-related information. Within this research stream, greenwashing is operationalized through the detection of selective disclosures and expressive manipulation of the content of sustainability reports. Selective disclosure is defined as a company intentionally emphasizing positive ESG achievements while omitting or downplaying negative aspects of its operations [109-114]. Expressive manipulation, on the other hand, involves using a promotional tone, emotional language, or biased narrative to influence stakeholder perceptions and create a favorable, yet potentially misleading, impression of the company's actual ESG activities and performance [111,112].\n\nOur SLR revealed that selective disclosure and expressive manipulation were most commonly identified using checklist-based manual coding, in which ESG topics were classified as disclosed or omitted and further distinguished as symbolic or substantive. In these studies, selective disclosure was typically measured as the proportion of omitted ESG items relative to the total number of expected disclosures, while expressive manipulation was quantified as the ratio of symbolically disclosed items to all disclosed items [106,107] or as the ratio of symbolic to substantive disclosure elements [115]. The overall greenwashing level was often computed as the geometric mean of the selective disclosure and expressive manipulation levels [115-117].\n\nOther researchers applied rubric-based coding frameworks, using author-designed diagnostic questions [109] or custom indicators [118] specifically developed to detect narrative exaggeration, unverifiable claims, and selective omission of sustainability information.\n\nAnother method for detecting greenwashing applies GRI-indicator-based manual coding, in which disclosures are classified as \"good news,\" \"neutral news,\" or \"bad news,\" and companies are subsequently evaluated on whether they systematically downplay or omit unfavorable information while emphasizing positive disclosures [110].\n\nSelective disclosure and expressive manipulation have also been examined using linguistic-textual methods. These methods relied on keyword frequency analysis and sentiment analysis to detect inflated positive language and patterns of symbolic communication [112,113]. They also combined lexicon-based techniques with stylistic and syntactic coding to capture narrative tone and discursive bias [111]. Finally, Yu et al. [114] applied a computational similarity-based method, demonstrating that templated sustainability statements with high textual similarity scores indicate generic and repetitive disclosure practices intended to obscure substantive performance.\n\nAn overview of methods used for operationalizing greenwashing in sustainability reporting based on selective and manipulative disclosure is presented in Table 4.\n\nTable 4. Methods for Operationalizing Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting based on Selective and Manipulative Disclosure.\n\n|  Type of Method | Author  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Checklist-based manual coding | Cao et al. [116]; Huang et al. [115]; Huang et al. [117]  |\n|  Custom rubric-based manual coding | Makrenko et al. [118]; Pimonenko et al. [109]  |\n|  GRI-indicator-based manual coding | Zharfpeykan [110]  |\n|  Linguistic-textual coding | Fiandrino et al. [111]; Gorovaia and Makrominas [113]; Yu et al. [114]; Zhu et al. [112]  |\n\nIn summary, selective and manipulative measurement approaches share a common conceptualization of greenwashing\u2014emphasizing positive information while omitting negative information\u2014but differ in how they quantify the phenomenon and in their sensitivity to detecting it. Checklist-based methods offer transparent assessments of selective\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/su18010017\ndisclosure and symbolic claims but are difficult to scale. Linguistic and NLP-based methods capture rhetorical cues such as tone, readability, and narrative patterns, though their accuracy depends on model quality and may produce results that diverge from checklist-based evaluations. Consequently, the literature increasingly views these methods as complementary: measuring both what is disclosed and how it is disclosed provides distinct yet mutually reinforcing insights into the multidimensional nature of greenwashing.\n\n### 3.3. Analytical Techniques for Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Using Content Analysis\n\n### 3.3.1. Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Through Tone Analysis\n\nAn expanding line of research examines how the tone of sustainability reporting\u2014captured through linguistic and sentiment cues\u2014functions as a proxy for detecting greenwashing.\n\nBased on Diction 6.0, Fisher et al. [119] analyzed six forms of tone\u2014positivity, activity, optimism, certainty, realism, and commonality\u2014as potential measures of obfuscation in corporate narratives. However, they found no evidence that tone was used for obfuscation; instead, they observed the opposite effect. In contrast, Esterhuyse and du Toit [120] examined narrative tones (certainty, optimism, activity, realism, and commonality) in large multinationals' human rights disclosures using Diction 7.1.3. They found that low-disclosure companies disproportionately relied on an optimistic tone\u2014particularly using terms denoting satisfaction and inspiration\u2014thereby signaling assertive impression management strategies. Drawing on the AFINN dictionary for word-level sentiment classification, Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez [69] also identified the use of impression-management practices in sustainability communication strategies.\n\nAdopting a slightly different approach, Zharfpeykan [110] assessed Australian companies' environmental and social disclosures, ranging from omission to fully quantified reporting of positive, negative, or neutral news, including violation-versus non-violation-related information. The study found that companies tended either to report representatively (balancing favorable and unfavorable items) or to engage in greenwashing by downplaying high-impact negatives while emphasizing less relevant positives. Using standard natural-language processing techniques, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] applied supervised sentiment analysis (positive/neutral/negative) to examine how a CSR report's environmental score\u2014defined as a text-based measure of environmental emphasis\u2014relates to positivity metrics, thereby evaluating two greenwashing mechanisms: decoupling and attention deflection. Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero et al. [74] further demonstrated that companies with the worst CSR performance, when using an obfuscation-based disclosure strategy, provide less balanced reports that emphasize overly optimistic content. In addition, Conrad and Holtbr\u00fcgge [121] showed that decoupling companies use fewer emotional references, more self-references, and fewer mentions of risk and anxiety, while relying more heavily on masculine-coded language.\n\nSome studies restrict their analysis to counts of positive and negative words, thereby suggesting that an overly optimistic tone may indicate greenwashing [122]. Building on Huang et al. [123], Hamza and Jarboui [124] employed a more elaborate method, assessing tone management in French companies' sustainability reports by counting positive and negative terms using the French version of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionary. They decomposed tone into a normal component, reflecting neutral descriptions, and an abnormal component, indicating the strategic use of tone management to inform or mislead stakeholders. Liao et al. [125] adopted a similar approach, analyzing the net positive tone of ESG reports (based on positive and negative dictionary of Tsinghua University) by Chinese listed companies and arguing that companies that \u201ctalk more and work less\u201d engage in tone management\u2014i.e. greenwashing. Liang and Wu [126] also applied this approach, using the \u201cBag of Words\u201d method and textual analysis of CSR reports from Chinese listed\ncompanies, and suggested that companies may engage in greenwashing through the use of an abnormally positive tone in their CSR disclosures.\n\nAn alternative approach was proposed by Chen and Ma [91], who used the Term Frequency--Inverse Document Frequency algorithm and derived an \u201cESG greenwashing tone\u201d from the frequencies of positive and negative emotion words and assessed greenwashing as the discrepancy between that tone and the firms' ESG performance. Chen et al. [92] similarly computed decoupling as the difference between an ESG report's optimistic tone\u2014estimated using the Loughran--McDonald lexicon\u2014and actual ESG performance, with both quantities standardized to z-scores, such that larger values indicate greater decoupling. A similar approach was employed by Sauerwald and Su [93] and Zhang [94], who linked the optimistic tone of CSR-reports to corporate social performance; however, Zhang [94] cautioned that relying on the tone--performance gap as a proxy for CSR decoupling has notable limitations.\n\n### 3.3.2. Detecting Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting Through Readability Analysis\n\nReadability analysis of sustainability reporting aids in detecting greenwashing by examining sentence length, word complexity, jargon use, and overall clarity, which may reveal when complex or technical wording is strategically employed to obscure weak CSR performance. Some studies treat greenwashing and report readability as distinct constructs yet find a significant negative association, indicating that lower readability corresponds to higher levels of greenwashing [127]. However, several studies directly infer greenwashing and obfuscation from the readability metrics in sustainability reports.\n\nLiao et al. [125] suggested that companies engage in greenwashing of ESG reports by \u201ctalking more and doing less,\u201d as evidenced by textual analysis of ESG-related word frequencies relative to overall report length (based on Loughran--McDonald's word list). A study by Esterhuyse and du Toit [120] revealed that low-disclosure companies engaged in obfuscation by reducing report readability, as measured by the Flesch Reading Ease Index, which accounts for average sentence length and syllables per word. Using the same index and based on the Textstat library, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] quantified the readability of CSR reports and interacted it with the environmental score to examine greenwashing mechanisms. In turn, Fabrizio and Kim [128] analyzed voluntary responses to CDP's Climate Change Survey to investigate linguistic obfuscation in environmental disclosures, using the Lingua::EN::Fathom package in Perl and the Gunning Fog Index to measure text complexity based on syllables per word and words per sentence. Mart\u00ednez-Ferrero et al. [74] showed that companies with poor CSR performance employ obfuscation strategies by producing longer, less readable reports containing less accurate and transparent information. They assessed report accuracy and clarity using metrics such as the total number of pages and words, the ratio of numerical characters to total characters and words, and highlighted that \u201csoft\u201d information (text) is more cognitively demanding to process than \u201chard\u201d information (numbers).\n\nSome studies use multiple metrics to assess the readability of sustainability reports. For example, Fisher et al. [119] analyzed corporate accountability disclosures using Flesch Reading Ease as the primary index, complemented by the Flesch--Kincaid, SMOG, and Gunning Fog. Similarly, Nazari et al. [129] applied a comprehensive set of readability and disclosure-size measures\u2014Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch--Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog, Coleman--Liau, SMOG, and the Automated Readability Index\u2014and found that shorter, less readable CSR disclosures were associated with poorer CSR performance, thereby suggesting the presence of greenwashing. Nilipour et al. [130] found that longer sustainability reports tend to have lower readability scores. Drawing on the ReadablePro online readability tool and using five readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau,\nSMOG, and Automated Readability Index), they suggested that information overload and reduced readability may serve to obfuscate negative information. Wang et al. [25] suggested that companies with poor CSR performance may engage in greenwashing by employing complex language to produce vague reports, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse stakeholder reactions. To assess the readability of CSR reports, they applied three indices--Fog, Flesch, and Kincaid--to evaluate the overall difficulty of comprehension.\n\nIn a slightly different approach, Conrad and Holtbr\u00fcgge [121] used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC2015) to analyze morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in sustainability reports, finding that decoupling companies employ less cognitively complex language and exhibit lower linguistic sophistication. Using the same software, Corciolani et al. [131] measured analytical and authentic language in CSR reports and showed that greater involvement in corporate social irresponsibility is associated with more narrative (as opposed to analytical) and more deceptive (as opposed to authentic) language.\n\nIt should also be noted that, using machine learning and text analysis, Pan et al. [132] identified an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental performance feedback and the readability of CSR reports among Chinese SMEs. In this case, readability was operationalized using a word2vec CBOW model trained on CSR reports to predict target words from their surrounding context.\n\n### 3.3.3. Detecting Greenwashing Through Visual Imagery Analysis\n\nConsidering how visual elements can be leveraged to influence sustainability reporting, Friedel [79]\u2014in one of the first studies in this field\u2014argued that the strategic use of imagery in CSR reports, such as depictions of Indigenous bodies and landscapes, was designed to alleviate public concerns about the environmental impacts of fossil fuel production and may represent a distinct form of greenwashing. Hrasky [133] examined the number, size, and types of graphs and photographs related to the three dimensions of sustainability\u2014economic, social, and environmental. The analysis revealed that sustainability-oriented companies used fewer photographs and relied more on quantitative data presented in graphical form within sustainability reports to highlight measurable impacts. In contrast, less sustainable companies pursued symbolic legitimacy, using imagery lacking concrete action as a greenwashing tool in sustainability communication with stakeholders. Cho et al. [80] identified the enhancement strategy by examining whether a significantly larger proportion of graphed items in sustainability reports displayed favorable trends. Additionally, they assessed obfuscation by identifying graphical distortions that presented favorable information, thereby serving as tools for impression management. A similar approach was adopted by C\u00fcre et al. [81] to identify enhancement and obfuscation as impression-management strategies, analyzing graphs with both favorable and unfavorable trends and detecting visual distortions used to manipulate perception.\n\n### 3.3.4. Evidence of Real Greenwashing\n\nWhile the existing greenwashing literature predominantly addresses alleged or theoretical cases, only a small subset examines instances that have been empirically verified.\n\nExamining the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Mobus [134] analyzed BP's pre-crisis CSR disclosures on environmental and safety performance, thematic trends in newspaper coverage during the crisis, and post-crisis findings on contributing conditions, thereby demonstrating the risks of relying on self-reported sources that provide strong incentives to emphasize favorable information while omitting adverse details. Du [135] used the Greenwashing Identification Committee's list\u2014published by South Weekend, one of China's most influential newspapers\u2014to detect greenwashing, thereby demonstrating that this list can serve as an empirical verification tool for confirmed cases. Using content analysis and\ncomparative evaluation of CSR reports against external data on Foxconn, Noronha and Wang [13] identified a disclosure--performance gap attributed to greenwashing. This gap stemmed from selectively highlighting positive aspects while omitting negative social performance details, particularly in cases involving incomplete disclosure and non-compliance with reporting guidelines. Analyzing the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Siano et al. [12] compared the Volkswagen Group's CSR reports with media coverage exposing the \u201cDieselgate\u201d controversy\u2014representing the public revelation of greenwashing\u2014and identified false claims and deliberate manipulation within these reports. Contreras-Pacheco and Claasen [136] identified clear signals of fuzzy reporting as a form of greenwashing. They examined the environmental disaster through events before, during, and following the incident, focusing on the company's disclosure practices, and found that the firm adapted its narrative over time to align with changing stakeholder expectations. In a related vein, Roszkowska-Menkes et al. [9] identified forms of selective disclosure by analyzing companies involved in severe controversies and assessing whether, and to what extent, these controversies and their associated negative events were reported in sustainability disclosures. Corciolani et al. [131], analyzing evidence of negative impacts on human rights, demonstrated how the language of CSR reports can be strategically used to offset companies' involvement in corporate social irresponsibility (CSIR). Finally, Gorovaia and Makrominas [113] analyzed how penalized environmental violations influence CSR report readability and sentiment, observing that violating companies tend to adopt a more assertive and overly positive tone while disclosing larger volumes of environmental information\u2014resulting in reports that are more extensive yet less readable.\n\n### 3.3.5. Oversimplified Assumptions of Greenwashing in Sustainability Reporting\n\nIn our opinion, some studies are built on assumptions that oversimplify the detection of greenwashing in sustainability reporting.\n\nSome scholars assume that merely issuing CSR reports by companies with poor corporate social performance\u2014or exhibiting a low degree of conformity with the GRI Sustainability Framework and Standards\u2014constitutes evidence of greenwashing, consistent with a symbolic management approach [137]. In this context, Karaman et al. [138] argued that the presence of greenwashing tendencies in the energy sector could be dismissed, as companies with superior CSR performance were more likely to issue CSR reports. Similarly, Koseoglu et al. [139] found that high-performing companies in the hospitality and tourism industry were more likely to publish CSR reports, adopt the GRI framework, and obtain external assurance\u2014thereby providing grounds for rejecting the greenwashing hypothesis in that sector. Mahoney et al. [140] posited\u2014consistent with a signaling theory perspective\u2014that stronger CSR performers issue reports to signal genuine commitment to sustainability, whereas weaker performers use them to project an image of responsibility despite poorer records, thereby engaging in greenwashing. However, it should be noted that none of these three studies employed content-analysis-based methods, which limits their ability to directly assess communicative or linguistic indicators of greenwashing.\n\nTaking into account other studies that, in our view, also oversimplify greenwashing detection in sustainability reporting, Lewis [141] argued that multinational corporations may be accused of greenwashing if they either omit any discussion of their supply chain's environmental impact or report on it only at the level of values and goals, without providing substantive or verifiable details. Additionally, drawing on an assessment of the quality of sustainability disclosures among Australian companies, Zharfpeykan and Akroyd [142] argued that companies tend to adopt greenwashing strategies when the quality of disclosures on material issues either declines or fluctuates\u2014patterns suggesting attempts to obscure weak social and/or environmental performance."

This study is based on an analysis of 188 comment letters submitted by such actors in the context of public consultations on the development of three new sustainable finance initiatives (the CFA Institute, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, and the New Zealand parliament). The study shows these actors' nuanced and often quite critical perceptions of the effectiveness of external assurance in preventing greenwashing and their reservations about its mandatory nature. These actors have raised various criticisms, including concerns about the vagueness surrounding verification practices; the lack of expertise available to conduct assurance in a new, specialized, and complex field; the costs of the assurance process, particularly for small players; and the lack of control over the reliability of the ESG data used. This article contributes to several emerging trends in the literature\u2014in particular, research on governance practices to prevent greenwashing, on the institutionalization of sustainable finance standards and laws, and on the role of rational myths in the assurance process for ESG disclosures.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nassurance process, audit practices, ESG investments, neo-institutional theory, rational myths, sustainable finance\n\n# 1 | INTRODUCTION\n\nSustainable finance, which is based on the integration of ESG issues into investment decisions, has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years (Migliorelli, 2021; Popescu et al., 2021). In 2020, ESG assets were estimated to exceed $35 trillion worldwide and are expected to represent nearly a third of all financial assets by 2025 (Bloomberg, 2021). The development of sustainable finance responds to the need to reduce ESG risks\u2014including those related to climate change and the reputational impacts of lack of commitment in this area\u2014and to support the financing of economic\n\nactivities that take these issues into account in a meaningful way (CFA Institute, 2022; Chiu, 2022; Cunha et al., 2021; Myers &amp; Czarnezki, 2021). However, greenwashing trends are increasingly criticized and raise fundamental questions about the transparency of ESG investment products (Baldi &amp; Pandimiglio, 2022; CFA Institute, 2022; Hetzner, 2022; Popescu et al., 2021). These criticisms are reinforced by the proliferation of these products and the virtual absence of regulation for practitioners in the field, who are raising increasing amounts of capital to finance supposedly sustainable activities (Chiu, 2022; Krasodomska et al., 2021; Migliorelli, 2021; Myers &amp; Czarnezki, 2021).\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors. Business Ethics, the Environment &amp; Responsibility published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.\n\nBusiness Ethics, Env &amp; Resp. 2024;33:617-632.\n\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/beer\nIn response to the need to regulate players in the field, various standard\u2010setting agencies, governments, and professional associations have begun to develop and adopt standards and laws on ESG disclosure for investment products, especially since 2019. These sustainable finance initiatives are very recent and, in some cases, still in draft form; in addition, the willingness and ability of practitioners in the field to adopt them seems, at best, uncertain. To reassure stakeholders on this issue, several initiatives have planned assurance processes that aim to use external audits to verify that sustainable investment products are in compliance with the ESG requirements they are supposed to meet. However, stakeholders' perceptions of this verification process remain unclear, as does the manner in which the processes will be concretely applied to the specific context of ESG disclosure for investment products.\n\nThe main objective of this paper is to understand the value and identify the challenges of ESG disclosure assurance in the process of institutionalizing sustainable finance standards and laws. More specifically, this paper addresses the following research question: Among people who have submitted contributions to consultations for the development of sustainable finance standards and laws, what is the perception about the assurance of ESG disclosures used for investment products? To explore this question, we used QDA Miner software to conduct a qualitative content analysis of 188 comment letters received during the consultation processes for three distinct sustainable finance initiatives, namely from the CFA Institute (an international group), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK, and the New Zealand parliament.\n\nThe research objective is important for at least four reasons. First, initiatives that aim to improve the quality of ESG disclosures for responsible investments address critical needs. Indeed, the lack of reliable information in this area and the risk of greenwashing are considered to be the main obstacles to the promotion and sound use of this type of investment (Benson, 2021; La Torre & Chiappini, 2021; Myers & Czarnezki, 2021; Popescu et al. 2021). Although sustainable finance standards and laws should in principle improve the confidence of investors and other stakeholders, it remains unclear how these instruments will be applied in practical terms. In the absence of an independent verification mechanism, it is reasonable to assume that the adoption of a self\u2010proclaimed sustainable finance standard will have little credibility and may add little value in the eyes of investors. This article therefore contributes to the literature on how to limit greenwashing in a new and still under\u2010researched area.\n\nSecond, the article contributes to the literature on the institutionalization process of sustainable finance, which currently includes very few studies on voluntary standards as regulation mechanisms (Chiu, 2022; Myers & Czarnezki, 2021; Popescu et al. 2021). Moreover, the focus on the assurance process makes it possible to highlight the challenges related to implementing and monitoring standards rather than examining their general objectives or particular design. The results of the study thus allow us to anticipate problems that have not necessarily manifested yet but that are likely to appear in the short or medium term.\n\nThird, the article explores the possible rational myth surrounding, on the one hand, sustainable finance standards' appearance of being rigorous, rational, and legitimate and, on the other hand, the reality of practices related to ESG investment products. It provides a better understanding of how normative pressures to introduce new standards have led to the emergence of a counter\u2010discourse on the effectiveness and relevance of assurance processes. Rational myths are often observed in sustainability management, due in particular to practices that, on the surface, aim to respond to institutional pressures in this area (Boiral, 2007; Gibassier et al. 2018; Perego & Kolk, 2012). The article thus contributes to the literature on rational myths and how they arise around activities that are central to the promotion of sustainability but that have not yet been the subject of extensive empirical investigation. In addition, this article demonstrates the relevance of neo\u2010institutional theory for studying the implementation of new standards in auditing and assurance (Haapam\u00e4ki, 2022).\n\nFourth, the article contributes to the literature on the external assurance of ESG disclosures. Stakeholders' views on the value and effectiveness of such assurance are largely neglected in the research on this issue (Krasodomska et al. 2021; Manetti & Toccafondi, 2012; Wong & Millington, 2014). Therefore, analyzing the submissions to the public consultations set up by the developers of sustainable finance standards to understand the contributors' perceptions sheds new light on the effectiveness of and problems with the assurance process.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review about the public's confidence in ESG disclosures for sustainable finance, notably by highlighting the rational myths surrounding the assurance of ESG disclosures in the context of sustainable finance. Section 3 presents the qualitative content analysis approach used in this research. Section 4 describes the results obtained from the content analysis. Section 5 includes the discussion of these results, their contributions to the literature, their managerial implications, and the limitations of the study as well as avenues for future research.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ASSURANCE PRACTICES\n\n### Building confidence in ESG disclosures for sustainable finance\n\nAlthough the proliferation of sustainable investments (e.g. ESG portfolios, green climate funds, socially responsible products and services, green bonds) seems at first sight to be an encouraging trend when it comes to the integration of sustainability into the financial sector, it raises increasing questions about the foundations of sustainable investments and the transparency of investment products' ESG disclosure (Baldi & Pandimiglio, 2022; Chiu, 2022; Migliorelli, 2021; Popescu et al. 2021).\n\nThese questions are fueled by suspicions that some of the sector's big players may have engaged in misconduct. For example, in 2022, Deutsche Bank was raided by the German securities regulator and the federal criminal police office following allegations that it had misled stakeholders and engaged in greenwashing\u2010like practices regarding so\u2010called ESG investments (Bloomberg, 2022; Hetzner, 2022). Because of instances like this one, ESG investors are concerned about\ngreenwashing issues. According to a study conducted by Quilter Investors in 2021, ESG investors' main concern is not their financial performance but that these investments may not be what they claim (Benson, 2021). This concern can be partly explained by the financial sector's lack of control over the quality and reliability of the data used in most ESG investments. These data are largely based on voluntary ESG disclosures made by companies (Cunha et al. 2021; Diouf & Boiral, 2017; Liang & Renneboog, 2020). The lack of transparency of these data, in particular the tendency to disclose positive information on sustainability achievements and to hide information that may damage an organization's image, has been widely highlighted in the literature (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, 2019; Haffar & Searcy, 2020; Hahn & L\u00fclfs, 2014; Higgins et al. 2020).\n\nThe non\u2010financial rating agencies that establish the sustainability performance rankings of companies, which are in turn used by ESG investors, also depend heavily on the information disclosed by companies (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, & Bernard, 2020; Boiral et al. 2021; Drempetic et al. 2020). In this context, the risk of greenwashing in sustainable finance seems to be closely linked to the much more documented risk of companies disclosing unreliable information in order to improve their image with stakeholders, including financial market actors (Boiral et al. 2021; Drempetic et al. 2020; Parfitt, 2022; Testa et al. 2018). This risk is exacerbated by the lack of regulation surrounding sustainable finance; the field has been increasingly denounced for its opacity, lack of rigor, and exaggerations (Ahlstr\u00f6m & Monciardini, 2022; Chiu, 2022; Chiu et al. 2022; Migliorelli, 2021).\n\nIn response to this shortcoming, numerous sustainable finance standards have been developed, particularly starting in 2019 (Chiu, 2022; Migliorelli, 2021; Myers & Czarnezki, 2021). In most cases\u2014including the Financial Sector Amendment Bill (FSAB), which is now law in New Zealand\u2014verification of such standards is based on external assurance that is supposed to give stakeholders confidence in the reliability of sustainable finance activities. The standards' emphasis on this assurance process reflects the existence of an \u201caudit society\u201d characterized in particular by the commodification of audits and the proliferation of audits in different sectors of activity (Boiral & Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, 2020; Power, 1997, 2021). It also reflects the normative isomorphism (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983) of audit practices and the \u201ccut and paste\u201d logic underlying them, as they rely on the transfer of professional rules, procedures, and institutional arrangements across different organizations and sectors (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, et al. 2020; Holder\u2010Webb & Cohen, 2012). In this context, although sustainable finance standards are recent and their implementation has not been extensively studied, the literature on the assurance of corporate sustainability disclosures can help shed light on the issues underlying the external audit practices for these standards and the most likely implications of these practices.\n\n### Institutionalizing the assurance of ESG disclosures for sustainable finance\n\nThe assurance of corporate sustainability disclosure has developed rapidly in recent years, particularly in large organizations (Al\u2010Shaer & Zaman, 2018; Mart\u00ednez\u2010Ferrero & Garc\u00eda\u2010S\u00e1nchez, 2017; Park & Brorson, 2005; Perego & Kolk, 2012). More than 60% of the sustainability reports of the 250 largest companies in the world were assured by supposedly independent auditors in 2022, compared to approximately 30% in 2005 (KPMG, 2022). This trend is explained by the need to improve the credibility and legitimacy of the information disclosed (Al\u2010Shaer & Zaman, 2018; Boiral & Gendron, 2011; Mart\u00ednez\u2010Ferrero & Garc\u00eda\u2010S\u00e1nchez, 2017). Indeed, stakeholders are increasingly denouncing the lack of reliability of this data, and pressure in this area can considerably damage corporate image (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, Brotherton, & Bernard, 2019; Higgins et al. 2020; Perego & Kolk, 2012; Ruiz\u2010Blanco et al. 2022). In recent years, a growing number of organizations, such as Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes\u2010Benz, Shell, ExxonMobil, and Walmart, have been subject to accusations and lawsuits due to their misleading claims about their sustainability commitments (O'Kane, 2021; Robinson, 2022; Truth in Advertising, 2022). These accusations have reinforced public skepticism about alleged corporate sustainability performance, including on the part of socially responsible investment (SRI) practitioners (Arvidsson & Johansson, 2019; Diouf & Boiral, 2017; Reimsbach et al. 2018).\n\nSeveral studies have shown that fund managers, financial analysts, and institutional investors consider ESG disclosures to be unreliable and inadequate to support responsible investment (Arvidsson & Johansson, 2019; Diouf & Boiral, 2017; Krasodomska & Cho, 2017; Solomon & Solomon, 2006). However, although the assurance process may reduce stakeholder skepticism, its actual effects on the quality and transparency of ESG disclosures remain the subject of controversy (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, 2020; O'Dwyer, 2003; Perego & Kolk, 2012). According to the mainstream literature, verification by external auditors tends to improve the rigor and reliability of sustainability disclosures (Al\u2010Shaer & Zaman, 2018; Cuadrado\u2010Ballesteros et al. 2017; Fuhrmann et al. 2017; Manetti & Toccafondi, 2012; Moroney et al. 2012). It also reduces the information asymmetry with stakeholders and strengthens corporate accountability for sustainability (Cuadrado\u2010Ballesteros et al. 2017; Fuhrmann et al. 2017). Various studies have shown that the existence of an assurance process improves confidence in the information disclosed, including among investors and ESG fund managers (Cuadrado\u2010Ballesteros et al. 2017; Fuhrmann et al. 2017; Manetti & Toccafondi, 2012; Moroney et al. 2012; Reimsbach et al. 2018; Stuart et al. 2021). For example, in a study with SRI practitioners, nearly 90% of respondents emphasized that the assurance process was important for improving confidence, reducing prevailing skepticism about the quality of ESG information, and better justifying investment decisions (Diouf & Boiral, 2017).\n\nHowever, this optimism about the benefits of external audits is being challenged by a growing number of studies (Farooq & de Villiers, 2020; Hickman & Cote, 2019; Michelon et al. 2015; Michelon et al. 2019). The main criticisms concern the opacity of audit practices, the questionable professionalism of auditors, the underlying economic issues, and the dubious quality of data from audited disclosures. First, the superficiality of audits and the vagueness\nof audit methods, scope, and materiality have been highlighted (Boiral & Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, 2020; Farooq & de Villiers, 2020; Jamali, 2010; Perego & Kolk, 2012). The audits' lack of depth and the uncertainties about the quality of the data verified are reflected in the predominance of audit results that provide only a limited level of assurance, which seems out of step with the importance of ESG issues and with stakeholders' expectations in this area (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, Brotherton, & Bernard, 2019; G\u00fcrt\u00fcrk & Hahn, 2016; Mock et al. 2013).\n\nSecond, several studies have criticized the professionalism of auditors, in particular their lack of training and their tendency to transpose accounting procedures onto very different ESG issues (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, et al. 2020; Krasodomska et al. 2021; Mart\u00ednez\u2010Ferrero et al. 2018; Ruiz\u2010Barbadillo & Mart\u00ednez\u2010Ferrero, 2022). Differences in auditor expertise and professionalism partly explain the discrepancies observed in audit quality and scope (Larrinaga et al. 2020; Perego, 2009).\n\nThird, studies have highlighted the managerial capture of audits, the business issues underlying the assurance process, and potential auditor conflicts of interest (Farooq & de Villiers, 2020; Michelon et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2011). In general, extensive research on ESG disclosure assurance practices shows the tendency to instrumentalize it to serve companies' interests rather than those of stakeholders (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, Brotherton, & Bernard, 2019; Jamali, 2010; Perego & Kolk, 2012).\n\nFourth, while the assurance process sends a positive signal to investors about the ethical culture of organizations (Stuart et al. 2021), studies show that it actually has little or no substantial benefit with regard to the quality of ESG disclosures or corporate misconduct (Christensen, 2016; Du & Wu, 2019; Michelon et al. 2015, 2019). Other studies have shown that ESG disclosure assurance had no impact on reducing the very high proportion (often more than 80%) of observed noncompliance with the reporting standards used by companies, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (Boiral et al. 2022; Boiral & Henri, 2017; Talbot & Boiral, 2018).\n\n### Responding to institutional pressures through rational myths\n\nMost studies that have analyzed the effects of assurance processes on the quality of the data disclosed show a gap between the reassuring image they project to stakeholders and what they actually deliver (Boiral et al. 2022; Boiral & Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, 2020; Michelon et al. 2015, 2019; Stuart et al. 2021). This gap is evidence of what is known as a rational myth. Institutional theory offers a sociological perspective for understanding the emergence of rational myths and, more generally, how organizations integrate norms, rules, and beliefs into their practices (Alvesson & Spicer, 2019; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977). According to this theoretical approach, organizations adopt new structures and practices in response to institutional pressures from various stakeholders, including governments and professional associations (Boxenbaum & Jonsson, 2017; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), as is the case for several sustainable finance standards. These pressures are not necessarily coercive or prescriptive. They can be normative, meaning linked to ethical considerations or professional requirements.\n\nMany organizations tend to conform with these standards in appearance, to maintain their reputation and social legitimacy, while their internal practices remain relatively inefficient and unchanged. The rational myths resulting from this superficial conformity can respond to various social pressures, including in the area of standardization and verification mechanisms. For example, the dissociation between, on the one hand, the institutional legitimacy of audits and their appearance of rigor, rationality, and ethics in the eyes of stakeholders and, on the other hand, their lack of transparency, professionalism, and effectiveness in improving the quality of ESG disclosure reflects the rational myths underlying the assurance process (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, 2019; Perego & Kolk, 2012). Various studies based on the neo\u2010institutional approach have shown the prevalence of rational myths in sustainability practices, notably because of the unreliability of the performance indicators used and the disconnect between organizations' concern for their image and the efforts they are really willing to make to reduce the impact of their activities (Boiral, 2007; Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, 2019; Gibassier et al. 2018; Jamali, 2010; Perego & Kolk, 2012).\n\nSeveral works on institutional theory have focused on the relationship between institutional pressures and the dissemination of new practices and norms (e.g. Frumkin & Galaskiewicz, 2004; Slack & Hinings, 1994; Tetteh et al. 2023). Boxenbaum and Jonsson (2017) point out that this attention is disproportionate. They also stress the importance of studying new relationships, particularly to better understand organizations' disconnects and isomorphism. This study focuses on an emerging field of research in institutional theory concerning the dynamics of contesting new norms and practices (Boxenbaum & Jonsson, 2017; Hoffmann & Zuelch, 2014). It contributes to a better understanding of rational myths concerning the assurance of ESG disclosures for sustainable finance standards by identifying criticisms that question the taken\u2010for\u2010granted utility of such assurance. It thus allows us to examine the role of normative pressures in developing a counter\u2010discourse on the relevance and usefulness of assurance processes. To our knowledge, this relationship has not been studied yet. This study also provides a better understanding of the institutionalization process. The latter is characterized by various actors' political efforts to influence the development and social acceptance of new norms (Dillard et al. 2004; Kaplan, 2018; Schneiberg & Soule, 2005). Finally, this study responds to Haapam\u00e4ki's (2022) call for more research using concepts from neo\u2010institutional theory to study the implementation of standards in auditing and accounting.\nThe objective of this study is to better understand the submission contributors' views on the value of ESG disclosure assurance in the institutionalization process of sustainable finance standards when it comes to improving the quality of disclosures. Given the novelty of the subject and the exploratory nature of the research, a qualitative study based on content analysis was deemed relevant. This method is indeed particularly useful for better understanding new and emerging phenomena (Gephart, 2004; Hsieh & Shannon, 2005).\n\n### Data collection\n\nA preliminary search was performed to identify all the drafts of standards and laws on sustainable finance around the world (n = 13). This search was performed in English, as most of these initiatives are global and therefore available in this language. Many general keywords were used to search for these initiatives online, notably \u201csustainable finance\u201d and \u201cESG.\u201d Gray literature (e.g. professional journals, reports, news articles) was also consulted to refine the search and discover relevant initiatives. To be included in this research, the draft standard or law had to be linked to sustainable finance and have been subjected to public consultations for which the comment letters were publicly available. The latter inclusion criterion was verified by consulting each initiative's website. Moreover, in the particular case of this research project, the comment letters for the draft standard or law had to cover the subject of assurance. Some draft standards were therefore excluded because they were not specific to sustainable finance (n = 4), the comment letters were not publicly available (n = 5), or the comment letters did not discuss assurance issues (n = 1) (see Appendix 1).\n\nFollowing the inclusion process, three draft standards and laws were included in the study. The first is the Global ESG Disclosure Standards for Investment Products from the CFA Institute, which covers ESG issues more broadly on a global level. The CFA Institute initiated three rounds of public consultation for this draft standard between August 2020 and July 2021, which allowed the research team to gather 117 comment letters. The final standard was published at the end of 2021. The second draft standard included in the study is the Proposals to enhance climate\u2010related disclosures by listed issuers and clarification of existing disclosure obligations from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This standard is specifically designed to help align disclosures with the Task Force on Climate\u2010related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for businesses listed in the United Kingdom. It was subjected to public consultations starting in March 2020, for which 14 comment letters were collected by the research team. The standard was approved in December 2020. The third initiative included in this study is a draft law called the Financial Sector (Climate\u2010related Disclosures and Other Matters) Amendment Bill (FSAB) proposed by the New Zealand parliament. This draft bill, focused on climate\u2010related disclosures, was subject to public consultations starting in April 2021, and the research team collected 57 comment letters. The bill was adopted by the New Zealand parliament and received royal assent in October 2021. To date, the assurance process is still voluntary for all the standards and laws included in the study.\n\nOverall, the research team collected 188 comment letters totaling 2526 pages of .pdf documents. These comment letters came from 164 individual submission contributors, as some contributors sent comment letters for more than one public consultation. Among these submission contributors, 101 were included in the study, as they commented directly on the assurance process. These submission contributors mainly self\u2010reported as being asset managers (n = 45), consultants (n = 19), service providers (n = 11), and representatives of professional associations (n = 11) and non\u2010profits (n = 8).\n\n### Data analysis\n\nAn inductive qualitative content analysis was performed for this study (Thomas, 2006). This approach consists of classifying and condensing the raw data using recurring themes and codes to understand the emerging patterns (Thomas, 2006; Varpio et al. 2020). This study used the theory\u2010informing inductive data analysis approach. This approach emphasizes the central role of data analysis in choosing a theory (Varpio et al. 2020). Researchers may have several theoretical perspectives in mind when designing the study, but theory choice occurs during data analysis. In this case, the coding process influenced the choice of rational myth as the theoretical lens.\n\nThe coding tree was developed in several stages. First, all the included comment letters were transferred into the QDA Miner software, which is designed to help with categorizing, sorting, and analyzing qualitative data. A preliminary categorization grid was used to begin the categorization process. Next, two coders worked separately on the categorization. Discussions (n = 3) between the members of the research team helped to further refine the grid by creating, deleting, merging, and splitting codes. The categories used in the grid were also carefully defined to help ensure the consistency of the process. When both coders agreed on the categories involved and adopted a similar categorization pattern, the categorization process was resumed by one of the coders. At the end of the categorization process, 478 passages related to the assurance process were coded into 17 categories (see Appendix 2). Other main themes included in the broader research project on public consultations for sustainable finance standards, such as the general characteristics of disclosures and the format of the standards, were also used to put our data on the assurance process into context. Quotes from submission contributors were identified to illustrate the main results. Relevant percentages were also calculated, even though this type of quantification is generally not suitable for qualitative study (Gephart, 2004; Pratt, 2009).\n## RESULTS\n\n### Mandatory assurance as a rational myth\n\nMost submission contributors recognized the tendency toward greenwashing in sustainable finance products and the need to put into place an effective regulatory system to prevent abuses. Despite the rapid development of these products, their credibility and even their future may be seriously compromised by the lack of clear, recognized, and correctly applied rules on the foundations and criteria of sustainable finance. In general, it is not so much the existence of a standard on the issue that raises debates, but rather the way it is implemented by the organizations concerned. In this context, the assurance process is seen as necessary to improve both the image of sustainable finance actors and the credibility of the ESG products they offer. In addition, most of the submission contributors were familiar with external auditing practices, which are commonly used in the finance sector. The promotion of external audits also encourages a logic of self\u2010regulation and thus helps to justify avoiding \u201ccommand and control\u201d regulations. In some submission contributors' view, auditors also contribute to organizations' learning process with regard to sustainable finance by providing recognized external expertise on ESG issues that are often poorly understood and by exposing misleading information on alleged corporate sustainability performance, as exemplified in the following quotes:\u201cWe have been concerned with the risk of organizations taking advantage of investors misunderstanding of ESG labeled investment products. (CIBC Asset Management; CFA Institute) One of the most criticized aspects of current ESG disclosure is that it does not provide any assurance on the products' actual impact on the ground\u2014whether the investments are actually contributing to environmental, social and governance outcomes. (Jungmin Joanne Lee, CFA; CFA Institute) \u201d\n\nDespite the general support for the usefulness of external verification, positions were more divided on whether it should be voluntary or mandatory. Most submission contributors expressed concern about finding the right balance between the need for more control to prevent abuses in sustainable finance and the need not to overly constrain practices in this area. Approximately 26% of the submission contributors who discussed this were nevertheless in favor of the introduction of mandatory assurance. Proponents of mandatory assurance pointed out that the rigor and success of a standard depends on its external verification. Without it, there is a strong risk that the standard will not be applied rigorously and therefore will not have a real impact on the greenwashing tendency of financial products. Some submission contributors also believed that mandatory assurance is part of the normal evolution of sustainability disclosure, which should be subject to the same rules as in the financial field, where external audits are often mandatory. More generally, mandatory assurance would also play a disciplinary role in the market by strengthening the professional integrity of practitioners and reducing uncertainty. For example:\u201cWe support independent assurance by qualified assurance practitioners to validate GHG emissions. We also support independent assurers being regulated, being required to have the appropriate technical expertise and having to abide by an ethical Code. (Insurance Council of New Zealand; FSAB) To elevate information on environmental, social and economic outcomes to the same relevance and quality as financial information, key elements should be subject to equivalent rigorous internal and external controls, including assurance. (Impact Investing Institute; CFA Institute) \u201d\n\nHowever, 47% of submission contributors were against mandatory assurance despite their support for assurance in general. Most of them stated that assurance should be voluntary and recommended as best practice. An analysis of the reasons for this opposition highlights important shortcomings in assurance practices.\n\n### Challenges to rational discourse on the assurance process\n\nSubmission contributors' opposition to making sustainability disclosure assurance mandatory in the context of sustainable finance reflects, to a large extent, why none of the three standards or laws studied impose such a practice. The numerous comments on this subject illustrate some of the inherent limitations of assurance and revolve around four interrelated issues: the vagueness of the methods used in the assurance process, auditors' lack of legitimacy, the underlying economic issues, and uncertainty about the effectiveness of assurance.\n\nFirst, the vagueness of assurance methodologies was highlighted by 38% of submission contributors who commented on assurance issues. This vagueness is not only related to uncertainties about the new standards and how they will be applied but it also relates to the assurance process itself, in particular its scope, methods, and timing. What information is assured and what is not needs to be clarified. Among other things, assurance could cover the design of ESG products, the organizations in charge of their implementation, or various ESG disclosure procedures (e.g. policies, performance monitoring mechanisms, and screening methods). The verification procedures, their frequency, and the periods covered by the assurance also remain to be determined. The composition of investment products is often variable and diversified. In this context, assurance could project an overall impression of confidence and reliability when the verification is actually focused on a limited portion of ESG products or\na limited time period. Furthermore, the level of assurance applied to sustainability disclosures is rarely high. Some submission contributors feared that the same will be true for the assurance of sustainable investment products; ideally, this should be based on extensive verification, but in practice, the industry is not necessarily inclined to do this, partly because of the costs involved. In this context, the audits are likely to be rather superficial and focus on the design of investment products rather than their actual implementation. The subjectivity of certain analyses and the differences in the rigor of the verifications or in the interpretation of the standards by different assurance providers may also encourage misleading statements about the real meaning and scope of the assurance, as exemplified in certain comments:\u201cWhile in theory independent examination is ideal, for other ESG\u2010related standards, not all reviews are equally stringent or cover the same matters. Care should be taken in the design of a verification process for the Standard to not introduce this lack of comparability, and to design a uniform verification process/standard.(CFA Societies Canada ESG Working Group; CFA Institute)Consideration should be given to making sure that the examination is robust, and does not degenerate into a tick\u2010the\u2010box process.(Hymans Robertson; CFA Institute)\u201d\n\nSecond, concerns about the legitimacy, professionalism, and independence of auditors were highlighted by 35% of submission contributors who addressed assurance issues. The main criticisms in this regard concern the lack of expertise available to conduct rigorous and recognized assurance on ESG disclosures for sustainable finance. The standards are new, and few players have developed sufficient knowledge to carry out the assurance process, which is generally seen as technical, sophisticated, and complex. In the absence of training and professionalization through recognized professional organizations, finding this expertise may represent a major challenge for investors. Several respondents expressed concern that it will simply not be possible to find assurance providers capable of verifying the ESG disclosures covered by the standard. Moreover, it takes time to develop the skills and professional bodies needed to institutionalize sustainable finance best practices and the verification of such practices by qualified auditors, and clearly, the players in the field have not sufficiently anticipated the needs in this regard. The mismatch between needs and available expertise also risks reinforcing unscrupulous and unprofessional behavior on the part of some auditors. Various respondents raised concern about auditors' lack of independence and the high risk of conflicts of interest. In this context, it may be premature to impose binding measures on assurance practices whose procedures and professionalism remain, at best, uncertain. The submission contributors expressed this point as follows:\u201cAssurance standards are by their very nature highly technical and a high level of expertise will be needed to ensure that the assurance is conducted to the appropriate standards. It will take time to build assurance capability and competency following the development of reporting systems, controls and capability.(Institute of Directors (NZ) Inc; FSAB)Close personal relationships (e.g. dating, vacationing together) between members of the verifier's team and individuals at the investment manager who are able to significantly influence the verification or matters relating to the investment manager's compliance with the Standards would also pose independence issues.(Ernst & Young LLP (UK); CFA Institute)\u201d\n\nThird, approximately 21% of the submission contributors mentioning assurance issues highlighted the economic and institutional issues underlying the assurance process. The main concern is the cost of verification, particularly for small asset managers. According to some respondents, the pressure to mandate the assurance of ESG investment products, as in the case of financial data, may favor large asset managers such as banks and institutional investors that can afford this type of practice. These large players may therefore reinforce their dominance in the market. The same applies to assurance providers. The assurance market\u2014including corporate sustainability disclosure assurance\u2014is to a large extent dominated by the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, namely Deloitte, Ernst & Young (EY), KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), as well as a few large consulting firms. Some submission contributors are concerned that the pressure and requirements for assurance would mainly benefit these large firms, which have diversified their activities considerably and have the resources to create audit teams relatively quickly. Smaller accounting and consulting firms would therefore be penalized. These concerns were expressed especially during the consultations on FSAB, which initially included specific measures on the qualification and accreditation of assurance practitioners. This measure was withdrawn from the draft law following stakeholder consultations because of the underlying commercial issues and pressure, particularly from non\u2010accountant professionals, as explained in the following comments:\u201cSome submitters were concerned that the requirements to become an approved assurance body could exclude non\u2010accountants from carrying out GHG assurance engagements. They noted that there are other professionals, including carbon and energy professionals, who have the skills and experience needed to carry out GHG assurance work.(Economic Development Science and Innovation Committee, 2021, p. 5)\u201d\n\nIn general, assurance practices in sustainable finance were seen as a potentially very lucrative new market, but one that risks benefiting too\nfew players. Some submission contributors also felt that the industry is sufficiently regulated and that adding new rules for assurance would add to the constraints already placed on investors and thus discourage the adoption of sustainable finance standards, especially by smaller players. For example:\u201cIntroducing third\u2010party compliance around these kinds of disclosures bring an additional layer of expense to this process which will undoubtedly hamper smaller asset managers\u2014you also end up developing a subset industry of auditors who themselves have to be policed. (CFA Society South Africa; CFA Institute)An assurance standard which is instead linked to the accountancy profession who are relatively new to the carbon management field is likely to disadvantage smaller, more cost\u2010effective, local assurance providers in favor of the big four global accounting firms. (Lin Roberts, Senior Lecturer in Sustainability and Environmental Management at Lincoln University; FSAB)\u201d\n\nFourth, although the assurance process is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of the data, approximately 19% of submission contributors who commented on this process expressed skepticism about it. This is mainly because the reliability of sustainability disclosure depends primarily on the quality of corporate sustainability performance data or the rankings by the non\u2010financial rating agencies that rely on this data. If these data are not reliable at the source, it is difficult for investors to make informed decisions on ESG investments that risk being misleading due to the \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d principle. Submission contributors highlighted the lack of rigor and reliability of information and analysis on companies' sustainability performance. In this context, the assurance process does not address a deeper and more fundamental problem over which investors and auditors do not have control. Moreover, sustainable finance standards do not directly address the quality of corporate sustainability disclosures but rather the principles and best practices for investment products' ESG disclosures (e.g. SRI policy and objectives, mechanisms for monitoring and addressing applicable regulations, disclosure of sustainability materials, sources of information used, procedures for addressing climate change issues, consideration of ESG risks, and screening methods in place). Regardless of these good practices, auditors tend to take for granted the quality of the information on which disclosures are based, in particular the rankings used. In this context, the application of standards and their verification may have little impact on the reliability of information that, upstream of investment products, may be based on greenwashing rather than on evidence. Several respondents also highlighted the lack of measurability and comparability of ESG data, which does not allow for a rigorous assurance process. The complexity and often highly diversified nature of investment funds makes it even more difficult for external auditors to verify the information. More generally, sustainable finance standards and associated verification seem, to a large extent, dissociated from real ESG impacts and, according to some respondents, could even reinforce greenwashing rather than reduce it, as mentioned by some submission contributors:\u201cWithout naming and categorization standards and established minimum standards for ESG product features, investors could confuse a \u201ccompliant presentation\u201d with one that achieves a standard of ESG investment practice. In other words, the Standards could facilitate rather than mitigate \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d (Investment Funds Institute of Canada; CFA Institute)We think any independent examinations at this stage would be premature and ineffective. ESG ratings services provide inconsistent results and there is nothing to suggest auditors will be able to make any better assessment. (The Asset Management Group of the Securities Industries and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA AMG); CFA Institute)\u201d\n\n### The way ahead\n\nWhile criticisms of the assurance process make it unrealistic to require it systematically for sustainable investment products, the consultations highlighted some of the solutions suggested by submission contributors. These solutions revolve around measures that allow for a gradual and circumstantial strengthening of the constraints associated with the external verification of ESG disclosures.\n\nFirst, about 16% of the submission contributors who commented on the appropriateness of the assurance process felt that it should be voluntary at first and only become mandatory after an adaptation period of a few years (two or three years was the most frequently mentioned period). This adaptation period could give practitioners sufficient time to become familiar with the standards and develop appropriate skills. Several respondents also argue that during the discretionary adoption phase of sustainable finance standards and verification by external audits, assurance practices could quickly become de facto mandatory due to market pressures. Investment managers who voluntarily adopt these practices will indeed have a comparative advantage over those who do not, especially in a context marked by skepticism about the reliability of sustainable finance products and by greenwashing trends. The voluntary adoption phase of assurance could thus serve as a test for this practice and eventually make its institutionalization through binding regulations more legitimate. This gradual approach would also reduce the costs and resistance associated with the assurance process and would eliminate the risk of sanctions against organizations that do not comply with the obligation to use external assurance. The flexible and progressive approach advocated should therefore facilitate the spread of sustainable finance standards and\nmake assurance a best practice rather than a formal requirement. For instance:\u201cThere is no need to make it mandatory, at least at outset. Recommended as best practice, it should become a de facto standard over time. Asset managers who do not provide it will, in time, be trusted less. (Ario Advisory; CFA Institute) \u201d \u201cA fairer and more reasonable approach would be to grant entities a transitional, probation reporting period of up to two years during which penalties would not be applied. This would enable best practise reporting to develop. It would also ensure sufficient expertise is built up to support independent, audited, verification of disclosures. (Insurance Council of New Zealand; FSAB) \u201d\n\nSecond, approximately 13% of submission contributors who commented on assurance suggested making it mandatory under certain conditions only or limiting assurance to specific issues. In particular, contributors suggested that the size of the organizations should be considered and that assurance obligations should be proportionate to the organizations' means and the volume of assets concerned. According to some submission contributors, the materiality of ESG issues should also be taken into account. For example, the assurance requirement could only cover certain issues deemed critical, such as climate change, and exclude others that may be seen as less material. However, the practices for assessing materiality remain unclear and were not specified in the comment letters reviewed. Other submission contributors emphasized the need to modulate the assurance requirement according to the controls that already exist. For instance, external audits could be required only in regions or for activities that are not already subject to regulations related to sustainable finance. According to some submission contributors, the use or lack of internal audits of ESG assets should also be taken into account. Lastly, submission contributors suggested that explanations could be required on the reasons for not using external assurance or on activities that are outside the scope of the assurance engagement. These various proposals ultimately aim to reduce the costs and constraints associated with a monolithic approach to external assurance, without calling into question the legitimacy of such an approach. These aspects were mentioned by submission contributors as follows:\u201cWe strongly urge the CFA Institute to revise the recommendation for an independent examination to exclude circumstances when an investment product is regulated and already subject to extensive legal requirements and regulatory review and examination. (Investment Company Institute (ICI); CFA Institute) \u201d \u201cIntroducing [third\u2010party assurance] for the largest and most climate\u2010material companies but phasing for others would allow (a) for companies to learn from larger (presumably better resourced companies) and (b) those providing the service to build skills and capacity. (Brunel Pension Partnership; FCA) \u201d\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe objective of this study was to understand the value and identify the challenges of the assurance process for ESG disclosures on investment products by examining the perspectives of actors who commented on this issue in public consultations on sustainable finance standards. The focus on external assurance issues in the consultations was driven primarily by criticism of greenwashing trends and the need to regulate practices to ensure that \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d in supposed ESG investments. It is also explained by the economic and commercial stakes of the assurance process, in particular for the large accounting firms for which the verification of sustainable finance standards appears as a promising market within the framework of a broader diversification of their activities (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, et al. 2020; Perego & Kolk, 2012; Ruiz\u2010Barbadillo & Mart\u00ednez\u2010Ferrero, 2022).\n\nVoluntary assurance of ESG disclosures by external auditors may be the most appropriate tool for reassuring stakeholders about the quality and transparency of information without subjecting practitioners to overly restrictive measures. However, the implementation of assurance faces major challenges, in particular lack of control over the reliability of ESG data concerning economic activities upstream of the financial markets, lack of available expertise, and vagueness surrounding the process and costs of assurance. Because of these challenges, it is currently difficult to impose requirements for external assurance on ESG disclosures for sustainable finance products in order to prevent misconduct and greenwashing. Still, despite the reservations expressed by actors in the field, market pressures, and stakeholder expectations for greater transparency could soon make this practice de facto mandatory. However, its effectiveness is likely to be limited or even symbolic, especially in the early years of the adoption of these standards, during which it is unlikely that assurance providers will have had sufficient time to acquire the necessary experience and skills. More fundamentally, external verification of the ESG disclosure standards for investment products is unlikely to have a significant impact on the underlying causes of the uncertainties and greenwashing tendencies currently observed in sustainable finance.\n\n### Contributions to the literature\n\nThe article makes four main contributions to the literature. First, it contributes to the literature on greenwashing in ESG disclosure\nand the effectiveness of tools to prevent it, specifically external assurance. Critical research on the issue often stresses the importance of strengthening controls and regulatory pressures due to the trend toward the commoditization and managerial capture of audits (Boiral & Gendron, 2011; Farooq & de Villiers, 2020; Krasodomska et al. 2021; Myers & Czarnezki, 2021; Smith et al. 2011). However, the application conditions of this coercive mode of regulation are rarely explained in the literature, and neither are the challenges linked to its implementation or the perceptions of stakeholders on this subject. The article shows the difficulties inherent in the implementation of mandatory assurance in the field of sustainable finance according to the main actors concerned and explains their resistance to this direction. These difficulties are not only linked to the intrinsic limitations of assurance but also to auditors' lack of control over the more fundamental causes of greenwashing. The article highlights the ways in which the main actors in sustainable finance perceive the implementation of auditing practices that, in principle, aim to prevent a problem over which these practices actually have little or no real control. It also describes the way that sustainable finance depends on corporate disclosure practices and performance evaluations by rating agencies that establish rankings used by would\u2010be responsible investors. Upstream of the financial markets, the uncertainties surrounding the measurement of the sustainability impacts of economic activities, and companies' greenwashing tendencies have repercussions, further downstream, on the disclosures concerning ESG investment products. In this context, the imposition of assurance standards and procedures is likely to reinforce greenwashing by giving a \u201cgreen,\u201d rational, and reassuring appearance to investment products that lack real sustainability in the first place or whose real impacts cannot easily be measured appropriately. It is therefore reasonable to assume that assurance practices will make greenwashing problems more invisible and abstract. Practitioners are also likely to perceive these problems as being outside the formal responsibilities of ESG fund managers, who will have done their part by using auditing services.\n\nSecond, the article contributes to the emerging literature on the institutionalization of sustainable finance practices and the establishment of regulatory mechanisms for these activities (Chiu, 2022; Krasodomska et al. 2021; Migliorelli, 2021; Myers & Czarnezki, 2021). To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to analyze new standards in this area along with stakeholders' perceptions of their implications. This study responds to the call of Zaman et al. (2021) for more papers at the intersection of corporate governance and ESG. It also responds to Haapam\u00e4ki's (2022) call for more studies from a neo\u2010institutional perspective on the implementation of new standards in accounting. It is part of an emerging trend in institutional theory concerning the dynamics of contestation of new standards and practices (Boxenbaum & Jonsson, 2017; Hoffmann & Zuelch, 2014). In particular, it provides a better understanding of the rationale as to why some actors question the taken\u2010for\u2010granted utility of the assurance process. By focusing on the process rather than the outcomes of institutionalization, a less developed field in institutional theory (e.g. Dillard et al. 2004; Kaplan, 2018; Lawrence et al. 2001), it is possible to understand better the creation of rational myths concerning the assurance process of ESG disclosures (Dillard et al. 2004; Kaplan, 2018; Schneiberg & Soule, 2005).\n\nThe development of new standards to regulate so\u2010called responsible or green investment practices clearly reflects a need for regulation, which was indeed widely expressed during the public consultations. The institutional arrangements to meet this need revolve around two main points. The first is based on a legislative approach, which seems to be favored in some regions\u2014notably in Europe and New Zealand\u2014and by some practitioners. This approach tends to mandate the adoption of sustainable finance standards and binding verification mechanisms to ensure their effective implementation. The second is a voluntary approach in which standards and verification mechanisms represent best practices left to the discretion of practitioners. While the voluntary approach is predominant in the consultations analyzed, the opinions on the issue and the proposed solutions reflect a wide range of perceptions. Moreover, the predominance of a voluntary approach to implementing standards and verifying them through assurance is not only explained by the constraints and costs of coercive measures. It also reflects the financial sector's lack of maturity and readiness for new sustainable finance standards, which may prove difficult to implement and verify in a rigorous way.\n\nThird, the article contributes to the literature on the development of rational myths in the consideration of sustainability issues (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, 2019; Gibassier et al. 2018; Jamali, 2010; Perego & Kolk, 2012). These myths have mainly been observed in the implementation of standards concerning management practices, such as ISO 14001, and the disclosure of corporate performance, such as the GRI. To our knowledge, they have not been used in the context of sustainable finance standards or external assurance in this area. Haapam\u00e4ki (2022) stresses the importance of mobilizing concepts linked to neo\u2010institutional theory to study audit and assurance issues. This study provides a better understanding of how normative pressures can help us understand competing discourses concerning the efficiency and relevance of assurance processes. The obstacles mentioned in the consultations (e.g. lack of expertise, opacity in measuring corporate sustainability performance, vagueness surrounding verification methods, commoditization of audits) show that the rigorous and rational appearance of external verification for ESG disclosures in the context of sustainable finance is largely exaggerated. This appearance is mainly the result of the analogy with traditional finance standards and practices (Boiral & Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, 2020; Etzion & Ferraro, 2010), a point that was often put forward during the consultations. The normative isomorphism underlying the transfer of the auditing vocabulary and practices that have proven successful in finance to the much less structured field of ESG disclosures projects an artificial image of rationality and rigor. This image is thus to a large extent dissociated from what external assurance actually offers in practice. This rational myth tends to be reinforced by the large accounting firms that already offer a multitude of audit services and that wish to quickly establish their legitimacy in the field of sustainable finance.\nFourth, the article contributes to the literature on assurance practices in sustainability reporting. Although this literature focuses mainly on corporate sustainability disclosure and not on ESG investments (e.g. Al\u2010Shaer & Zaman, 2018; Manetti & Toccafondi, 2012; Michelon et al. 2015; Park & Brorson, 2005), it is relevant for understanding the motivations for and shortcomings of the assurance of ESG disclosures for sustainable finance. In both cases, assurance practices are essentially motivated by a concern for legitimacy and aim to establish trusting relationships with stakeholders (Jamali, 2010; Mart\u00ednez\u2010Ferrero & Garc\u00eda\u2010S\u00e1nchez, 2017; Perego & Kolk, 2012). Interestingly, the limitations and challenges mentioned by submission contributors are very similar to those identified in the critical literature\u2014e.g. the superficiality of audits, auditors' lack of qualifications to assess sustainability, and conflicts of interest (Boiral & Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, 2020; Farooq & de Villiers, 2020; G\u00fcrt\u00fcrk & Hahn, 2016; Perego & Kolk, 2012). The often harsh comments on the audit industry thus show the reflexivity of SRI practitioners. In most cases, these practitioners seem quite aware of the contradictions between, on the one hand, the need to promote the external verification of data to establish the legitimacy of their activities and, on the other hand, the virtual impossibility of setting up audits that are sufficiently rigorous to really assure stakeholders of the information's quality and transparency. More generally, this article responds to the need for further research on stakeholder perceptions of the institutionalization of audit practices and the quality of ESG disclosures (Diouf & Boiral, 2017; Krasodomska et al. 2021; Manetti & Toccafondi, 2012).\n\n### Managerial implications\n\nThe study has practical implications for sustainable finance practitioners, auditing firms, training institutions, organizations developing new standards in this area, and governments. While the widespread use of assurance practices for sustainable finance products is a predictable trend in the medium term given current institutional pressures to ensure data quality, investors and responsible investment practitioners more generally should not take the effectiveness and rigor of audits for granted. The added value of external assurance in improving the transparency and quality of ESG disclosures should be clarified before organizations use assurance services. The same applies to the expertise of auditors, the various assurance methods they plan to use, and the resulting costs.\n\nGiven the proliferation of sustainable finance products, the development of standards in this area, and the importance of market opportunities for audit firms, audit firms would benefit from quickly developing their organizational skills through training programs and the establishment of qualified audit teams. In general, the composition of the audit teams and their expertise have a significant influence on the quality of the verification of sustainability disclosures (Boiral, Heras\u2010Saizarbitoria, & Brotherton, 2020; Cuadrado\u2010Ballesteros et al. 2017; Fuhrmann et al. 2017; Zaman et al. 2021). However, due to the lack of expertise available in the market\u2014a problem that was often highlighted in the consultations\u2014the recruitment of specialists in both sustainable finance and external auditing practices currently represents a major challenge that, in some cases, may be insurmountable. In this context, audit firms should instead build diversified teams of distinct specialists from different disciplines to meet the demands and complexity of sustainable finance standard assurance. Training institutions, particularly universities with programs in accounting and finance, should also develop new courses or adjust the content of existing courses to meet the needs expressed by practitioners. Among other things, the various sustainable finance standards, their implications for investor practices, and the tools needed to verify them should be integrated into training programs.\n\nStandard\u2010setting bodies (e.g. CFA Institute, FCA, ISO, IFRS, IIRC, SEC, SASB) should also further coordinate their efforts to harmonize sustainable finance standards and their associated auditing methodologies. In the case of the three standards included in this study, the current lack of clarity on the criteria for external assurance, particularly in terms of background, expertise, and methodology, may undermine the standards' credibility.\n\nLastly, governments should closely monitor the development, implementation, and verification of this type of standard, including FSAB, which is a new legislation in New Zealand. Governments should consider implementing regulations based on specific standards or based on some of their recommendations. The same applies to the verification of such standards by external assurance. For example, specific regulations could require sustainable finance practitioners to adopt certain standards and have them assured by auditors meeting clearly defined criteria. Such regulations, with penalties for non\u2010compliance, would likely deter misconduct and exaggerations in sustainable finance. However, overly restrictive regulations may hinder the development of sustainable finance, as well as current self\u2010regulatory initiatives in this sector.\n\n### Limitations and avenues for future research\n\nThis study has some limitations that can be used to establish avenues for future research. As the sustainable finance standards and laws included in this study were still in draft form or in their infancy, it is still too early to judge their effectiveness and the rigor of their verification through external assurance. Future research could explore these issues further through case studies or in\u2010depth interviews with practitioners.\n\nThe present study is based on a qualitative content analysis that does not allow the results to be generalized. Moreover, the results obtained are directly linked with the three initiatives included in the study and are difficult to generalize to the context of other standards or laws. The content of the comment letters may also have been influenced by the interests of the actors involved, the content of the draft standards, or the political context. Future quantitative studies based on questionnaires covering\nWiley\n\nBusiness Ethics, the Environment &amp; Responsibility\n\nBOIRAL ET AL.\n\nthese issues could be set up to more broadly study the ways that stakeholders (e.g., institutional investors, fund managers, consultants, auditing firms, and investor associations) perceive the various standards, the usefulness of verifying compliance with the standards through external assurance, and the assurance's effects on improving investors' confidence in ESG investment products. These studies would certainly make it possible to measure the differences between stakeholders in terms of their perceptions of assurance practices, particularly regarding these practices' credibility and their effectiveness in preventing misconduct. The political and institutional issues surrounding the development of new standards would also benefit from further investigation, as they were not covered in the present study.\n\nAlthough this research is limited to the three standards that met the sample selection criteria at the time of the study, others are currently under development or under consideration and would benefit from investigation. This is particularly the case of the ISO 32210 standard on sustainable finance, which could become a reference standard. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), founded in 2022 by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with the aim of launching new sustainable finance standards, also seems destined to play a major role in this rapidly evolving field. The way in which some standards become institutionalized while others remain marginal or do not go beyond the draft stage could be explored further through longitudinal studies.\n\nAs the qualitative content analysis used in the present research was not appropriate to study the influence of regional, regulatory, and cultural specificities of perceptions of standards design and implementation, future research could explore these issues. However, given the weight of the underlying economic interests and social desirability biases related to sustainability issues, the actual perceptions and practices of sustainable finance actors remain difficult to clarify.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis project was supported by the Canada Research Chair in Internalization of Sustainability Practices and Organizational Accountability.\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION\n\nThere is no funding to declare for this article.\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n\nThe authors have no potential conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n## DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n## ORCID\n\nOlivier Boiral https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9722-7644\n\nMarie-Christine Brotherton https://orcid.\n\norg/0000-0002-3439-5800\n\nDavid Talbot https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9675-2703\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nAhlstr\u00f6m, H., &amp; Monciardini, D.

Barth*\n\nGraduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA\n\nThe Conceptual Framework identifies comparability as a qualitative characteristic of useful financial reporting information. This paper explains what comparability is, why comparability is desirable, how comparability is achieved, and when we might achieve it. In particular, comparability is the qualitative characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among, items; comparability aides investors, lenders and other creditors in making informed capital allocation decisions; and achieving comparability depends on firms applying a common set of financial reporting standards and on requirements in the standards, especially measurement requirements. The paper discusses research showing that greater comparability can lower costs of comparing investment opportunities and improving financial reporting information quality. When comparability might be achieved is uncertain, although much progress has been made recently.\n\n**Keywords**: Comparability; global financial reporting; International Financial Reporting Standards; Conceptual Framework\n\nThe Conceptual Framework of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB, 2010) specifies comparability as one of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting information, which enable that information to achieve the objective of financial reporting. That objective is to provide investors, lenders and other creditors with information that helps them in making their capital allocation decisions. Because capital is a scare resource, comparability is a crucial characteristic of financial reporting information. If investors, lenders and other creditors cannot make informed comparisons of alternative investment opportunities, their capital allocation decisions will be suboptimal. In fact, some believe that enabling investors to compare investment opportunities is the main reason we need financial accounting standards to prescribe the contents of financial reports. Without such standards, firms could portray and provide information about their financial position and performance in any way they choose. Given that financial reporting does not derive from a law of nature, there are innumerable ways firms could do that, and comparability would be lost. Thus, comparability is crucial to high quality financial reporting. This discussion seeks to explain what comparability is, why comparability creates benefits for investors and the firms in which they invest, how comparability can be achieved, and when we might achieve it.\n\n\u00a9 2013 Accounting Society of China\nWhat is comparability?\n\nAlthough the word \u2018comparability' has a meaning in the English language, financial accounting standard setters have a precise definition in mind. The Conceptual Framework explains that comparability is the qualitative characteristic of financial reporting information that enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among, items. That is, comparability results in like things looking alike and different things looking different. The Conceptual Framework goes on to explain that comparability makes financial reporting information useful because the information can be compared to similar information about other entities or about the same entity at a different time. Comparability does not relate to a single item; comparability requires at least two items that are being compared.\n\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it is important to clarify what comparability is not. Comparability is not consistency. Consistency refers to the use of the same accounting methods or principles by a firm for the same items over time. Comparability is a goal of consistency and, thus, consistency helps achieve comparability. In itself, however, consistency does not ensure comparability. Comparability also is not uniformity. This is a source of confusion for many. Comparability results in like things looking alike and different things looking different. Uniformity requires treating all things in the same way. As a result, uniformity can make unlike things look alike, which impairs, not enhances, comparability. For example, consider an accounting rule specifying that all buildings be depreciated on a straight-line basis using a 30-year useful life and assuming a 10% residual value. Thus, the depreciation method for all buildings would be the same. What if some buildings last 20 years and others last 200 years? What if some buildings have a 5% residual value and others have a 25% residual value? What if some buildings deteriorate more rapidly at first and others deteriorate more rapidly nearer the end of their lives? Unless all buildings have a 30-year useful life, a 10% residual value, and economic benefits that are consumed in a straight-line pattern, using the same depreciation method achieves uniformity, but not comparability. It makes all buildings look alike, when in fact they are different. That is not comparability.\n\nThe Conceptual Framework also explains that some degree of comparability can be achieved by faithful representation, which is one of the fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial reporting information. That is, if financial statements faithfully represent an item -- e.g. an asset or a liability -- then comparability should follow. This is because a faithful representation would reflect the characteristics of the item. In the building example, if the residual value of a particular building is 25%, not 10%, then depreciating the building assuming a 10% residual value would not result in a faithful representation of the building.\n\n## Comparability: why?\n\nWhy is comparability so crucial to financial reporting? The primary reason -- as with all qualitative characteristics of financial reporting information -- is to help meet the objective of financial reporting. That objective is to provide financial information about the entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. The Conceptual Framework explains that decisions to buy, sell, or hold equity and debt instruments require allocation of capital, and financial reporting is aimed at those who cannot demand the information they need to make those capital allocation decisions. Thus, comparability in\nfinancial reporting across entities and over time is crucial to enabling investors, lenders and other creditors to make more informed capital allocation decisions.\n\n## Comparability: how?\n\nHaving established the importance of comparability, the next question is how can it be achieved? This, of course, is not a simple task.\n\n### Global standards\n\nWhen many people think about comparability in financial reporting, they think about the increasing use of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This is, in part, because the stated vision for IFRS is:\u201c... one single set of high quality global standards ... used on the global capital markets.\u201d\n\nMany equate use of the same set of standards with achieving comparability. This vision for IFRS is based on the belief that use of global standards will improve the functioning of global capital markets. This should occur by increasing comparability and the quality of information, and by decreasing the costs of preparing financial reports, particularly for multinational firms, and information risk. Information risk is the risk that investors perceive when they know that they do not fully understand the information they are given, which would be the case if they are not \u2018fluent' in the accounting standards on which a firm's financial statements are based. Decreasing information risk should decrease the cost of capital.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine how comparability can be achieved without the use of global financial reporting standards. However, use of global standards is only a necessary step -- not a sufficient step -- to achieving comparability because, for example, the standards need to be rigorously applied and enforced. Ensuring any set of financial reporting standards achieves its potential ultimately depends on firms applying the standards as written, auditors auditing the resulting financial statements to ensure compliance with the standards, and regulators enforcing the standards.\n\n### Requirements in standards\n\nAlthough a focus over the last decade or so has been on the widespread adoption of IFRS as a means of achieving comparability, even strict adherence to a single set of standards does not ensure comparability. The requirements in the standards also affect comparability and, thus, should not be overlooked. Let me explain how and why.\n\nThe Conceptual Framework considers financial statement elements, e.g. assets, liabilities, income, and expense, item by item. Examples of financial statement elements are accounts receivable, inventory, and long-term debt. The aim of focusing on financial statement elements item by item is to provide investors with comparable information about the entity's assets and claims against those assets. Profit or loss is the change in the assets and claims that do not arise from other assets, liabilities, or transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. The assumption underlying this focus is that comparability results from portraying financial statement elements in the same way, for example by recognizing the same (sub)set of assets and liabilities and measuring them in the same way.\n\nHowever, does recognizing the same (sub)set of assets and liabilities achieve comparability? What if different assets and liabilities are important for some firms versus oth\nChina Journal of Accounting Studies\n5\n\ners? For example, what about intellectual property assets of knowledge-based firms; property, plant, and equipment for durable manufacturers; and insurance liabilities for insurers? Do we achieve comparability if some assets \u2013 e.g., intangibles \u2013 or particular types of claims \u2013 e.g., claims with uncertain outcomes \u2013 are omitted? Do we achieve comparability if we omit intellectual property assets for all firms? Unrecognized assets and liabilities also have direct consequences for comparability of profit or loss because profit or loss depends on changes in recognized asset and liability amounts. Thus, if an asset is omitted, by construction the change in its recognized amount is zero and, as a result, it has no effect on profit or loss. If we omit intellectual property assets for all firms, do the financial statements of a knowledge-based firm and a durable manufacturer reflect their similarities and differences in a way that enables investors, lenders and other creditors to make informed capital allocation decisions? I cannot see how they can.\n\n## Measurement\n\nMeasurement also plays a crucial role in comparability that is often overlooked. Because financial reporting standards focus on financial statement elements item by item, one is lulled into thinking that measuring the same asset in the same way helps achieve comparability. But, does it? What if the measure is modified historical cost? Although the method is the same, the resulting amounts likely differ. For example, the same asset purchased at different times will likely have a different measure. More differences can emerge over the life of the asset, e.g., if the asset is impaired or is part of a fair value hedge and, thus, its carrying amount is adjusted for the change in fair value attributable to the risk identified in the fair value hedge. How can modified historical cost achieve comparability?\n\nWhat if the measure is fair value? IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be obtained to sell an asset or transfer a liability between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value has the potential to achieve comparability because one would expect economic differences and similarities to be reflected in value. Thus, using fair values makes like things look alike and different things look different. However, a concern about using fair value is the potential effects of discretion in estimating the fair values. Although some assets and liabilities have readily determinable market values, others do not, which means that their fair values must be estimated by managers. Whenever estimates are used in financial reporting \u2013 which is almost everywhere \u2013 there is concern that managers will use their discretion opportunistically to affect the estimates. There is a vast academic literature that finds evidence of managers' opportunistic exercise of discretion relating to many accounting amounts, regardless of whether they are based on modified historical cost or on fair value.\n\nWhat if the measure were something else? Perhaps another measure exists that overcomes the undesirable features of both modified historical cost and fair value and possesses desirable features. Unfortunately, standard setters have yet to identify such an alternative measure.\n\nAs an example to illustrate the effects on comparability of using cost or fair value to measure all assets, consider three entities: Entity A, Entity B, and Entity C. Entities A, B, and C each owns one share of common stock in Entity Z. The acquisition cost is 20 for Entity A, 40 for Entity B, and 60 for Entity C, and the current fair value of a share of common stock in Entity Z is 45. Are the financial statements of Entities A, B, and C comparable if each measures its investment at cost? The answer is 'no' because the three cost amounts \u2013 20, 40, and 60 \u2013 make the asset look different when it is the same. Thus,\nBarth\n\ncost makes like things look different, thereby failing to achieve comparability. Are the financial statements of Entities A, B, and C comparable if each measures its investment at fair value? The answer is 'yes' because all three entities would measure the asset at 45, which means that the same asset held by different entities looks the same. That achieves comparability. However, this conclusion is only clear because the fair value was specified in this example. To the extent that Entities A, B, and C need to estimate the fair value, they might estimate different amounts. In such a case, whether cost or fair value provides more comparability depends on whether the range of fair value estimates is smaller than 40, i.e., 60 minus 20. That is, it depends on whether fair value results in making the same asset held by the three entities look more alike than cost.\n\nSome might argue that comparability is best achieved by reporting both amounts, for example if each entity measures the investment at cost and discloses the fair value. However, the Conceptual Framework is clear that disclosure is not a substitute for recognition and the limited academic research that exists on recognition versus disclosure tends to support that view.\n\nWhat about measuring different assets of the entity in different ways? Can this achieve comparability? For example, presently we measure many financial assets at fair value and property, plant, and equipment at modified historical cost. We impair accounts receivable for incurred credit losses; property, plant, and equipment to recoverable amount; and inventory to lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. We measure most long-term debt at amortized cost and derivative liabilities at fair value. There are many measurement methods used in financial reporting and most often the different measures apply to different assets. The question is whether this approach can achieve comparability.\n\nAs an example to illustrate this issue, consider the assets of Entity A and Entity B.\n\n|   | A | B  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Cash | 500 | 500  |\n|  Accounts receivable | 1000 | 1000  |\n|  Property, plant, and equipment | 1500 | 1500  |\n|  Total assets | 3000 | 3000  |\n\nThe reported assets of these two entities \u2013 3000 \u2013 make the assets look the same, and it appears that each entity's accounts receivable represents one-third of its assets and property, plant, and equipment represents one-half of its assets. If this reporting achieves comparability, then the two entities should have the same assets and these proportions should reflect the economics of the assets each entity holds.\n\nWhat if Entity A measures accounts receivable at fair value and property, plant, and equipment at modified historical cost, with all amounts in US dollars? Assume Entity A's property, plant, and equipment was purchased at various times over the last ten years. What if Entity B measures all assets at fair value and cash is stated in US dollars, accounts receivable is stated in euros, and property, plant, and equipment is stated in Swiss francs? Are these two entities comparable? Do the proportions of total assets each reports for the three assets reflect the economics of the assets? The answer is 'no'.\n\nHow does a financial statement user compare Entity A's property, plant, and equipment with Entity B's? In addition, what do the 3000 in total assets for Entities A and B represent? Are these amounts comparable to each other? Are they comparable to anything? Each 3000 is the sum of three numbers derived on different bases. Like the sum of apples and oranges, its meaning is unclear. Many might react to this example by say-\nChina Journal of Accounting Studies\n\ning that \u2018we would never account for Entity B\u2019s assets using different currencies and that would be true\u2019. However, the distinction between using different currencies for Entity B\u2019s assets and using different measurements for different assets for Entity A is not clear. Why do we recoil at one and accept the other without question? One likely reason is that we are not accustomed to one but are accustomed to the other. Is there any other reason?\n\nCan we achieve comparability if we measure the same asset in different ways \u2013 either for the same entity or different entities? For example, presently we treat computers as inventory for some entities (e.g., Apple) and as equipment for others (e.g., General Electric). We treat warranty obligations relating to sales of goods by retailers differently from insurance contracts issued by insurance companies even though they are both insurance contracts. We treat real estate as investment property for some entities (and measure it at fair value) and as property, plant, and equipment for others (and measure it at amortized cost). We treat the gain or loss on an item designated as hedged in a fair value hedge differently from the same gain or loss on an item that is not so designated (i.e., in a designated fair value hedge, we adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item for its change in value attributable to the hedged risk). In addition, we permit optional asset revaluation, application of fair value, and hedge accounting itself. All of these differences result in differences in amounts in the financial statements for what seem to be the same assets and liabilities.\n\nConsider an example. Assume Entity A and Entity B each buys a piece of construction equipment for 200. Entity A classifies the equipment as inventory and Entity B classifies it as property, plant, and equipment. Six months later, both entities still own the equipment; Entity A holds it in inventory and B has depreciated it because it is available for use, but Entity B has not used it. Entities A and B both dispose of the equipment for a gain. In its income statement, Entity A displays revenue and expense, which net to the amount of the gain, and Entity B displays the gain net. The asset \u2013 a piece of construction equipment \u2013 is the same for both entities. Yet, the asset is measured at different amounts and the gain on disposal of the asset is presented differently. The question is whether the financial statements of Entities A and B are comparable.\n\nConsider another example, which is often used to illustrate this issue. Assume that Bank A and Bank B each buys US Treasury securities at a cost of US$ 1 million. At the reporting date, the fair value of the securities is US$ 1.2 million. Bank A classifies the securities as trading (or fair value through profit or loss) and recognizes US$ 1.2 million in assets and a gain of US$ 0.2 million. Bank B classifies the securities as held to maturity (or amortized cost) and recognizes US$ 1.0 million in assets and no gain or loss. In both cases, the bank owns the same asset \u2013 US Treasury securities \u2013 purchased for the same amount \u2013 US$ 1 million \u2013 and now worth the same amount \u2013 US$ 1.2 million. Yet the financial statements of Bank A and Bank B are quite different. Does this financial reporting make like things look alike? That is, are the financial statements of Entities A and B comparable? The answer is \u2018no\u2019.\n\n## Does \u2018use\u2019 of an asset affect its economics?\n\nA question relating to comparability to which we do not have a good answer is whether two assets that seem the same (e.g., computers) are economically the same if they are used differently (e.g., as inventory or property, plant, and equipment). If the use of an asset affects its economics, we need to identify how the economics are affected so that we can determine whether and how the differences in economics should be reflected\nwhen accounting for the asset. Accountants have been treating seemingly similar assets differently for a long time -- the inventory versus property, plant, and equipment example is not new. However, we have never articulated why. Without knowing why different uses of an asset affect the economics of the asset that should be reflected in the accounting, it is not possible to determine when and how to reflect such differences. In addition, we need to know whether the notion of different uses of assets applies to all assets. In particular, does it apply to financial assets and liabilities? IFRS 13 concludes \u2018no' and explains why. But more thought needs to be devoted to this notion as it applies to non-financial assets.\n\nRecently, the notion that the use of assets should affect the accounting for the assets has been characterized as reflecting an entity's \u2018business model'. Thus, the question can be rephrased as whether different \u2018use' of an asset depends on the entity's \u2018business model'. Unfortunately, the Conceptual Framework has no concepts about the role of business model in financial reporting. In addition, there is no definition of a business model and, thus, it is unclear what the term means. Some question whether an entity's business model differs in any substantive way from management intent (Leisenring, Linsmeier, Schipper, & Trott, 2012). Is the business model something that management is doing, plans to do, or only hopes to do? Is an entity's business model verifiable? Is it auditable? The answers to these questions are not obvious, which only adds to the lack of clarity about why and how a business model or intent should affect financial reporting.\n\n## What does research say?\n\nAcademic research provides evidence that global financial reporting with greater comparability can be beneficial to investors, by lowering costs of comparing cross-border investment opportunities and, for some countries and firms, by improving the quality of their financial reporting information. Research also shows that comparability can be beneficial to firms by increasing cross-border investment and by lowering cost of capital, presumably from reducing information risk and, for some, by increasing financial reporting quality. However, research also provides evidence that these potential benefits are tempered by cross-country differences in implementation, incentives, and enforcement.\n\nOne example of a study in this literature is \u2018Market Reaction to the Adoption of IFRS in Europe' (Armstrong, Barth, Jagolinzer, & Riedl, 2010). The questions motivating this study are: (1) did investors perceive net benefits to adoption of IFRS in Europe? and (2) if there were net benefits, are the net benefits associated with increased comparability or increased quality of financial reporting information? As with any single research study, this study cannot directly answer these questions. However, these motivating questions lead to two research questions that the study can answer. The first is: did the European stock market react positively (negatively) to regulatory events that increased (decreased) the likelihood of IFRS adoption in Europe? An affirmative answer to this question indicates that investors perceived net benefits to IFRS adoption in Europe. The second is: were there differences across firms depending on their pre-adoption information environment? Identifying differences across firms in the market reaction to the regulatory events provides insights into what firm characteristics are associated with the perceived benefits of IFRS adoption.\n\nThe study focuses on 16 regulatory events, which begin with the 2002 European Parliament resolution requiring all listed firms in the European Union to apply IFRS by 2005. The events end with the 2005 European Commission endorsement of the revised fair value option. The events and predicted signs of the effect on the likelihood of IFRS adop\nChina Journal of Accounting Studies\n\n|  Event Date | Reaction to the Adoption of IFRS in Europe \u2013 Individual Events  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Description | Predicted sign  |\n|  Mar 12, 2002 | European Parliament passes resolution requiring all EU listed companies to use IFRS by 2005 | +  |\n|  May 14, 2002 | EFRAG issues draft recommendation to endorse all extant IFRS | +  |\n|  June 19, 2002 | EFRAG issues final recommendation to endorse all extant IFRS | +  |\n|  July 4, 2003 | Chirac sends letter to Prodi expressing concerns about IAS 39 and its potential negative effect on Europe | -  |\n|  July 9, 2003 | Bolkestein sends letter to Tweedie supporting adoption | +  |\n|  July 16, 2003 | ECOFIN and ARC support adoption of IFRS | +  |\n|  Sept 29, 2003 | EC endorses all extant IFRS, except IAS 32 and IAS 39 | +  |\n|  Feb 3, 2004 | Bolkestein pledges to postpone endorsement of IAS 32 and IAS 39 until issues are resolved; sets up consultative group to facilitate resolution | +  |\n|  Mar 30, 2004 | HSBC announces intentions to implement IAS 39 in full | +  |\n|  June 4, 2004 | EFRAG issues draft recommendation to endorse IAS 32 and IAS 39 | +  |\n|  July 8, 2004 | EFRAG issues final recommendation to endorse IAS 32 and IAS 39 | +  |\n|  Oct 1, 2004 | ARC recommends endorsement of IAS 39, but recommends provisions relating to the fair value option and portfolio hedging of demand deposits be carved out | -  |\n|  Nov 19, 2004 | EC endorses IAS 39 with both carve-out provisions | -  |\n|  June 16, 2005 | IASB issues revised IAS 39 with new fair value option | +  |\n|  July 8, 2005 | ARC recommends endorsement of revised fair value option, thereby eliminating one of the carve-outs | +  |\n|  Nov 15, 2005 | EC endorses revised fair value option, thereby eliminating one of the carve-outs | +  |\n\nFigure 1. Reaction to the adoption of IFRS in Europe.\n\ntion are listed below. For example, the positive predicted sign for March 12, 2002 indicates that the study assesses this event as increasing the likelihood of IFRS adoption in Europe. The negative predicted sign for July 4, 2003 indicates that the study assesses this event as decreasing the likelihood. This event is Jacques Chirac, then President of France, sending a letter to the President of the European Commission stating that adoption of IFRS in Europe, particularly International Accounting Standard 39, the financial instruments standard, would have negative effects on the economy of Europe (see Figure 1).\n\nThe study finds an overall positive reaction to these events, and interprets this finding as indicating that investors perceive net benefits to IFRS adoption. The study also finds that the market reaction is incrementally positive for firms with lower pre-adoption information quality and higher information asymmetry, and incrementally negative in code law countries. The study interprets these findings as indicating that investors perceive net benefits from increased financial reporting quality, but they are concerned about enforcement, which prior research finds is less rigorous in code law countries. Importantly, the study finds that there is a positive market reaction even for firms with high pre-adoption information quality, such as firms that use US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or cross-list in the US. Because this positive market reaction cannot be attributed to increased financial reporting quality, the study interprets this finding as indicating that investors perceive benefits associated with comparability.\n\nA second study in this literature is 'Are international accounting standards-based and US GAAP-based accounting amounts comparable?' (Barth, Landsman, Lang, &amp; Williams, 2012). The questions motivating this study are: (1) is comparability with US GAAP reporting higher after IFRS firms adopt IFRS? and (2) does comparability differ across firms and has it increased over time? The study addresses three research questions. The first is: are accounting system and value relevance comparability with US GAAP-based accounting amounts higher after the IFRS firms adopt IFRS? An affirmative answer to this question indicates that IFRS-based accounting amounts are more comparable to US GAAP-based accounting amounts than amounts based on the IFRS\nfirms' prior domestic GAAP. The second is: are there differences for voluntary versus mandatory adopters, for firms from common versus code law and high versus low enforcement countries, and in more recent years? Identifying differences across firms and years in comparability with US GAAP-based accounting amounts provides insights into where and when comparability is greater. The third research question is: are earnings smoothing, accrual quality, and timeliness of earnings potential sources of increases in comparability? Answering this question provides insight into the potential sources of comparability, which enhances our understanding of how greater comparability is being achieved.\n\nThe study bases its inferences on a sample of firms from 27 countries that adopt IFRS from 1995 to 2006 and a sample of US firms matched on size and industry. The measures of comparability are based on assessing differences in how accounting amounts based on IFRS or US GAAP relate to economic outcomes. The economic outcomes are stock price and stock return, and the accounting amounts are earnings and equity book value. Accounting system comparability assesses the differences between predicted economic outcomes resulting from applying US GAAP and IFRS pricing multiples to each firm's accounting amounts. Value relevance comparability assesses differences between explanatory powers of accounting amounts for economic outcomes. The study employs metrics for earnings smoothing, accrual quality, and timeliness of earnings that have been studied in prior literature.\n\nThe study finds that comparability with US GAAP-based accounting amounts is higher after firms adopt IFRS. It also finds that both accounting system and value relevance comparability are higher for IFRS firms that adopted IFRS mandatorily, for firms from common law legal origin and high enforcement countries, and in more recent years. These findings are consistent with the effects associated with incentives of voluntary adopters reducing comparability, enforcement of standards enhancing comparability, and greater convergence between US GAAP and IFRS and other aspects of the financial reporting system increasing over time, thereby increasing comparability. Although US firms have higher value relevance than IFRS firms, value relevance is comparable to US firms for IFRS firms from common law and high enforcement countries. Finally, earnings smoothing, accrual quality, and earnings timeliness are all potential sources of greater comparability.\n\n## Comparability: when?\n\nThis is the big question. In the last ten years or so, we have been witnessing widespread adoption of IFRS and more global consistency in implementation and enforcement of the standards. Most countries are now part of the IFRS family -- the last big holdout is the US -- and efforts are underway to globalize auditing standards and coordinate enforcement by regulators. Thus, there has been progress on comparability that can be achieved by using the same accounting standards. However, more needs to be done. In particular, it is important for all entities to apply all standards that are word for word the same around the world -- not \u2018almost the same as', \u2018similar to', or \u2018based on' IFRS. Until all entities apply exactly the same standards, the necessary first step in achieving comparability will not have been taken.\n\nThe next step is to ensure that the requirements in standards achieve comparability. Unfortunately, standard setting is slow and the process results in evolutionary changes to financial reporting. The IASB employs an extensive due process to ensure all voices are heard and debates fully all aspects of every proposed change. Thus, changing\nstandards takes time even if we all agree. But, we do not. There are many unresolved questions that engender debate, some of which I have raised in this discussion on comparability: What do we mean by \u2018like things' and \u2018different things'? Does use of an asset change its economics? If so, how and why? What measurements should we use for various assets and liabilities and why? What information do investors need to make their capital allocation decisions and, thus, what information should financial statements portray? Regardless of the outcomes of the debates, inevitably there will be change that we, collectively, need to be willing to accept. Change, whatever it is, seems quite difficult for most people to embrace.\n\n## A word about the US\n\nAny discussion of global comparability in financial reporting must at least briefly address the situation in the US. A brief review of history reveals that the US has been an active, supportive player in international accounting standards for a long time. Before 2001, the US was actively involved in the International Accounting Standards Committee, the predecessor to the IASB. The US also played an active role in the Strategy Working Party that laid the groundwork for the establishment of the IASB in 2001. In 2007, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) removed the requirement for non-US registrants to reconcile their non-US GAAP-based net income and equity book value to those based on US GAAP -- provided that the registrant applies IFRS as issued by IASB without modification. In 2008, the SEC issued a \u2018Roadmap' for possible adoption of a single set of global standards. In 2010, the SEC confirmed its commitment to a single set of standards and issued the SEC staff \u2018Work Plan' to achieve that objective. In addition, from early in the IASB's history, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board and the IASB have worked closely together to converge the two sets of standards.\n\nIn 2011, the SEC articulated a possible method of incorporation of IFRS into the US financial reporting system, which was referred to as a \u2018condorsement' framework. Condorsement is a newly created word designed to convey a combination of convergence, whereby a country maintains its local standards but over time modifies those standards to be more like IFRS, and endorsement, which involves incorporating individual IFRS into existing local standards. The endorsement process envisioned in the condorsement framework is not fundamentally different from other countries' endorsement processes. In 2012, the SEC Staff issued its Final Report on the Work Plan, which summarizes the observations and analyses of the staff regarding six key areas identified for study in the Work Plan, but does not contain any recommendations by the Staff or decisions by the SEC regarding whether IFRS should be incorporated into the US financial reporting system or how any such incorporation should be implemented.\n\nThe world is awaiting the SEC's next move regarding whether and how to incorporate IFRS into the US financial reporting system. It is unclear when the SEC will make any decisions relating to IFRS -- most likely it will not be until 2013 or later. What is clear is that comparability is key to the SEC's decision. Comparability is one of the main motivations for the US considering a move to IFRS.\n\n## Concluding remarks\n\nComparability in financial reporting is key to promoting efficient allocation of capital. The adoption and consistent implementation of IFRS is a crucial, necessary first step in\nBarth\n\nachieving comparability. An often overlooked second necessary step is the need to improve the standards themselves relating to recognition and measurement to truly achieve comparability. The progress towards comparability in the last ten years or so has been breathtaking. There always is room for improvement, but we are getting closer to achieving the goal.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis article is based on the keynote address at the 2012 China Journal of Accounting Studies conference in connection with Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, as well as addresses at the Fundaci\u00f3n Ram\u00f3n Areces and Autonoma University; Journal of Contemporary Accounting conference at Tamkang University; Shanghai National Accounting Institute CFO Forum; and School of Accountancy Research Conference at Singapore Management University.
